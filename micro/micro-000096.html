        Plex suddenly decided to delte all my library meta-data. I happened after I changed the DB backup lcoation. I was too lazy to figure out how to restore it so I’ll just recreate the libraries and let plex reindex them

        Plex thumbnail generation ate up quite a bit of disk space on the c-drive during the holiday. At least they put an option to change the destination folder to store the cached data.

        I’m much more comfortable using the external monitors than I am using the laptop. The difference wasn’t this huge a coulpe of years ago but currently I really don’t like laptop screens and keyboards.

        played quite a bit of com3 but I ‘m stuck at a level which is impossible with my current crew. It is essential to keep crew members alive as the XP bonuses are required to beat the advanced levels. I’ll prbably start over and try to complete missions without any loses.
