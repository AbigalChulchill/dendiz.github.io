2018-12-05 20:42:55 	  after this optimization 5m row went down to 1k. but the ratio of scored scans is 1k/6k.  still a lot of n/a scores displayed. this could be due to prediction checker exiting at 2*atr. I&apos;m gonna try 5y worth of data then turtle exits
2018-12-05 20:54:21 	  &apos;code is art&apos; was a quote I saw on the WordPress site. Arts sole purpose is itself ergo any piece of useful code is by definition not art. another perspective would code is more art than science. which would really only be applicable to the underlying function. maybe they meant looking at code is pleasant which maybe true for the obfuscated C code entries that look like ascii art. the algorithm implemented maybe elegant but that&apos;s independent from the code anyway.
2018-12-06 07:28:57 	  increasing the data to 5y made the caches blow up with OOM errors. I had to reduce the chart data cache to 1/5 size. That made the technical calculations super slow, as the correlation calculation were querying the DB for each other symbol. Now I put another cache for correlation calculations that just holds the last 30 days closing price. <a href="https://mastodon.dizman.org/tags/devlog" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>devlog</span></a>

I had already been using Telegram and iMessages but kept whatsapp around for people who were to lazy to switch. Then a couple of weeks ago I responded to people who sent whatsapp messages that I will no longer be using it and asked to reach me via Telegram/iMessages. Surprisingly enough everybody accommodated this request and I no longer use the facebook owned app.
