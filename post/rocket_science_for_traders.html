        <p>This book takes an interesting approach to technical analysis in that it treats 
the price data as time series data and tries to apply digital signal processing 
techniques to reduce the noise. It’s of course not a silver bullet and you won’t 
get rich by applying these but it gives good explanations on the logic and 
reasoning behind such filters (like moving averages etc).</p>
<p>The maths behind required to understand what's going on is pretty advanced
(Fourier transforms, phase shifts, etc) so it's not super easy to following along
and the reasoning behind the applications is usually omitted or not explain in detail
or in laymans terms.</p>
<p>The results of the systems presented in the book seem to the on the profitting side
but there is not indication that the testing system is based on simulating real
transactions with comissions, slippage, etc. Also the commodities chosen as examples
could very well be selected to match the system to yield good looking results. I'm
pretty sure the author is not faking any results but I would still need to independently
run and reproduce these results on his data set and other sets to begin trusting and 
invest time in tuning the given systems.</p>
<p>Overall I think it's an interesting book and the author is taking a fresh approach 
on applying DSP techniques to a different type of signal.</p>
