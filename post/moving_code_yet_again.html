        <p>About a year ago I decided that I would run my own git server and host my pet projects. After all why the hell am I paying for a VPS with 2 gigs of RAM if I am not gonna be able to host my small git server? Well it turned out that 2 gigs of RAM isn’t a hell of a lot and my server is in constant swap-land which degrades performance a lot. So I’ve decided to move the stuff to gitlab. Why not github? because I like the idea of having private repositories in which I can host shitty projects that haven’t been shaped yet. So my gitlab profile is <a href="http://gitlab.com/u/dendiz">here</a> and I will be redirecting git.dendiz.com to this URL when I have the chance to do so. It was fun using the gogs project while it lasted and I’m sure they will add great features in the future (nice alliteration;) )</p>
