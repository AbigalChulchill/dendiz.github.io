<ul>
<li>firing arcs</li>
<li>AI target selection</li>
<li>support units</li>
</ul>
<p>I put off working on indirect/direct firing weapons for a couple of days to get
the basics of targeting and arc display going, but now that I have that down, I
added types of different range selection. Indirect firing weapons don’t require
a direct line of sight, these will be weapons like rockets, or attack drones.
Direct fire weapons are your classical AC and laser type weapons. L.O.S is
normally a tricky thing to implement when you are doing it for an arc F.O.V but
the weapons in this game are simple, and only have effect on files and ranks.
So no diagonals means easier L.O.S sigh implementation. Just keep looking at
the next tile in the direction you are scanning in and if you hit a target or
blocker stop progressing in that direction.</p>
<p>Targeting got some love today as well. I had already implemented ranged weapons
for enemies and their targeting arc was visible on the map when the player was
moving, but the units did not engage the target even it if came into range. I
changed that today. If an enemy detects a player unit in firing range it will
drop it’s current target and go after the player unit. If it was committed to
an attack when the player unit jumped into range, it will still carry out the
committed attack then pursue the player unit. The adds a bit of variety to the
AI units. It is still relatively easy to tip-toe around the firing arc of the
enemies but may a smarter AI that guards choke points on the map (like a
mountain passage with a single tile width way to access an area of the map)
would make for some interesting tactics and game play.</p>
<p>Not all units in an army are there to engage and attack. Well at least not
until it’s a last resort so I added a support unit that will increase the armor
of the enemy units as long as it is alive. It will try to center itself
relative to it’s team mates, but I may change this movement heuristic to a more
evasion biased heuristic, like run away from the player.  I’m kind of worried
if this will actually lead to all the support units grouping in one corner of
the map while trying to stay away from the player. The logic behind trying to
center them was to simulate an area of effect range for the armor boost.</p>
<p>The number of unit types are increasing so here is a a little info on the types
so far with some of their stats:</p>
<h2>Basic enemy</h2>
<p><a href="/img/ittb-e1.png">/img/ittb-e1.png</a></p>
<p>This guy only has melee attack with damage 1-3, armor 2 + X (based on level), speed 1 – 4</p>
<h2>Advanced enemy</h2>
<p><a href="/img/ittb-e2.png">/img/ittb-e2.png</a></p>
<p>This guy has a melee weapon and a ranged weapon. These can get pretty dangerous as they can
switch targets and start going after the player units if they can lock onto the player.</p>
<h2>Armor support enemy</h2>
<p><a href="/img/ittb-e3.png">/img/ittb-e3.png</a></p>
<p>These guys don’t attack the player, but provide an armor boost +1 to all enemy unit while
they are alive.</p>
