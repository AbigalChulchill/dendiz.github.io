        <p>So, in the last movement video there were ship passing through each other like they were ghost ships of some sort. I could have just added a mesh collider and blew up the ship when they touched each other but that wouldn’t really make sense for ship of the same player. No same captain wouldn’t deviate from a collision course with a friendly ship (unless they’re unconscious or something). So the simplest way was to let one of the ship wait until the other one passes, and then carry on with the navigation.</p>
