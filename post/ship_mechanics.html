        <p>over the last week I’ve been thinking about how the ship mechanics should function. I wanted to come up with something that doesn’t require micro-managing a fleet of ships but is yet flexible enough for a nice tactical combat. The method I’m going to try out has the following properties</p>
<ul>
<li>Ships have a limited amount of fuel. If that fuel runs out the ship is useless. It cannot move, attack or defend itself.</li>
<li>Each turn N amount of fuel is converted into N*10 amounts of power.</li>
<li>Power can be used for shields, lasers or movement.</li>
<li>The player can decide how much of this power is used by which system, no power is wasted because after setting the shield and laser amounts the rest is used for the engines.</li>
</ul>
<p>This looks to a like sweet spot is managing the ships vs stream lining battles but I can’t be sure until I have actually played some battles.</p>
