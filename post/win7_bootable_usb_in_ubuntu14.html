        <p>Apparently the new versions of unetbootin fail on creating a bootable Windows 7 USB so some extra actions have to be taken with Ubuntu 14.10.
First make sure that your USB is formatted as NTFS. To do this you can start gparted and it should list the file system type as NTFS. If not just re-format the USB stick to NTFS. Make sure the partition has the boot flag on. If not just right click and choose manage flags and and the boot flag. Now copy over the files from your Windows 7 ISO over the USB stick. You can do this by mounting the ISO file in Linux using the command</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mount -t  loop isofile /mnt
</code></pre>
<p>now you can just copy all the files in the /mnt directory to the USB drive. Now itâ€™s time to install grub on the USB drive so that it can boot into Windows  7 installation.
Launch gparted again and choose your USB from the devices drop down on the left. Now right click on the partition and choose information. In the dialog that opens there is a field called UUID make note of this field on a piece of paper as we will need it during the boot.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo grub-install --target=i386-pc --boot-directory=&quot;/mnt/boot&quot; /dev/sdX
</code></pre>
<p>where sdX  is the device for your USB.</p>
<p>All is set, reboot from the USB stick and you should be in the grub bootloader screen. Now type these commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">insmod ntfs
search --fs-uuid --set root
chainloader +1 
boot
</code></pre>
<p>and your Windows installation should start.</p>
