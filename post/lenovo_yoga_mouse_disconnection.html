        <p>I just got a Microsoft Comfort Sculpt Bluetooth mouse, to free up the USB ports on my Lenovo Yoga 2 pro laptop, but I soon faced the problem that many other users were facing</p>
<p>mouse freezes suddenly
mouse disconnects
Doing some research quickly revealed quite a bit of people were facing the same issues with this product. The problem is with the windows 8.1 bluetooth drivers. The solution is simple uninstall the current drivers.</p>
<p>Important! Before you proceed make sure your D drive contains the lenovo provided restore utilities including the blue tooth drivers. If you do not have these or are unsure do not proceed!</p>
<p>Press CTRL + X and select device manager from the popup on the bottom right.</p>
