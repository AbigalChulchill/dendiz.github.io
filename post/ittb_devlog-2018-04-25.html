        <h2>summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>performance/code improvements</li>
<li>jump jet mechanics, game mechanics</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been skimming through the code so far, which is around 2K lines right
now, and I have noticed some inefficiencies and some simplification that could
be made. GD Script doesn’t really provide an extensive language so a lot of
things have to be done the old fashioned way. I guess their motto is, C doesn’t
have those fancy constructs and they’re doing fine, why shouldn’t we? So I did
a couple of one-liner fixes and some code reduction here and there, nothing too
big. A couple of bug crawled into the code making it possible for the player to
gain super Mech attack powers, like attacking even after the attack action had
been consumed.</p>
<p>Like that wasn’t enough the ranged weapons could fire beyond their ammo limit.
I fixed that too, so no more Bruce Lee mechs, kicks every bodies ass.</p>
<p>One of the items that I want to add is a jump jet, that will get the player
beyond blocked tiles. This will give the ability to jump over the enemy to
their behind and attack them. And also get out of hairy situations like this</p>
<p><img src="/img/ittb2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The item isn’t pick-able yet, but the movement mechanics are there. So the item
should be ready within the coming days.</p>
<p>I also wanted the player to prioritize building protection as this is supposed
to be a tower defense game.  Now if you lose more than X building across all
levels, the game is over.</p>
<p>I’m thinking of a turn counter so that you may just have to protects the
buildings for X turns, but this also brings the mechanic of running away from
the monsters if you have high speed or a jump jet. This is kind of refuted by
the newly spawning enemies. But I also wanted to try out the mechanic of water
flooding, killing buildings, enemies, mountains or anything else in it’s path
eventually cover the whole map.</p>
