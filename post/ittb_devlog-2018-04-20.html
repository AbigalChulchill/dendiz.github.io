<ul>
<li>map generation</li>
</ul>
<p>Generating chunks was a good idea but not all chunks are perfect. There are
cases that some chunks may leave isolated tiles and/or buildings after the
generation. E.g</p>
<pre><code> 0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0
 1 1 0 0
 0 1 1 0
</code></pre>
<p>this chunk is totally OK as long as it‚Äôs not placed at the bottom left
quadrant. If it is the bottom left tile is an island and pointless. Since we
are playing on an limit 8 x 8 board, we can‚Äôt have useless islands taking up
precious space. So to battle this I set out the write a connectivity check from
tile to tile and tile to building (all building need to be reachable as well).</p>
<p>Tile to tile checking is easy with a DFS and check if every tile node is
visited. Build to tile check required a pairwise reach-ability check.  It takes
about 1 ~ 2 seconds to generate a valid map, which is acceptable. Next up the
movement of pieces and enemies where happening with place swaps, so it was
impossible to tell who went where and what happened. I decided to draw a route
line that indicated what happened to understand the movement of pieces better.
This lead to me realizing a bug in the path finding code and I changed that
completely.</p>
<p>Previously I was using a BFS with a parent/child relationship map and back
tracking the nodes to build the path. I switched over to Lee‚Äôs algorithm which
is similar in concept but simpler. There is a more detailed approach on this
algorithm somewhere on the blog (try searching for graph path finding).</p>
<p>With the path finder working again I completed the line drawing showing the
route the pieces had taken and also prevented pieces from jump over other
pieces blocking their way. This made the game a bit harder and more
restricting,</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know how it will impact the feedback during test plays.</p>
