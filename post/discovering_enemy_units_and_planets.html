        <p>At first I though that the game could be a game of perfect information where you know where all the planets are and where your enemies are based. But then first I made the planets invisible so you have to explore around to find planets to colonize. Then I though well Iâ€™ll also make the enemies invisible until you scan them. The procedure is quite simple: Every ship and planet has a set property called exploredBy. When creating the units you add yourself to the set. Then during the Update() call of every ship in transit you scan the neighboring cells with a radius of N and if there is anything on that cell you add yourself to their explored list and make them visible. Setting a sight line of 1 is okay for planets but could be dangerous for enemy ships as you would end up right in the middle if you go the max distance. So setting this to 2 or 3 is going to better I guess. But this is also a tactical choice: Do you spend all your power on the engines and have nothing attack/defense when you end up in the attacking range of an enemy ship, or do you travel less but have your guard up?</p>
<p>Here is the new stuff in action on a very small map for testing purposes</p>
