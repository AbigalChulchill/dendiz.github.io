        <p>Honestly during COVID I didn't have the chance to use a lot of bags (but this didn't stop me from accumulating more ðŸ˜…). This backpack was no exception, but in the last few weeks I have been trying to go out more and take a bag with me.</p>
<p>So how did I find this bag? Well after spending a lot of time on Amazon I realized that some companies offer the exact same bag with different branding for different prices. This is known practice called white labeling. But this type of deeper research enabled me to find this bag which I think is made by the same factory that makes the Direct Action Dragon egg mk2 bag but skips the branding and sells it for half the price. Either this or they just cloned it. It's made from durable nylon material (probably 500D) and has laser cut molle webbing in the front. It has some organizational pockets which are good for storing small items like a wallet, airpods, etc. and offer quick access. The main compartment is big and offers a mesh pocket. It can easily accommodate an A4 rocketbook, 13&quot; iPad, mid size tech organizer, headphones. The laptop compartment is at the back and you have to get the straps out of the way to access them. It looks like it offers decent protection and can also be used as a hydration bladder compartment.</p>
<p>The zippers are good quality and silent with some rope attached to function as the handle you pull on. The top handle is braided and looks cool but I'm a bit concerned it's going to come undone. The hardware is lacking in quality as it can't hold the straps in place properly and they slide. I need to take some extra measures to fix them. Not sure if it's water proof as I haven't used it in rain, but fall is upon us and I will go out to test that.</p>
<p>Overall it's a cool looking bag and good value.</p>
