        <p>I mentioned on my micro blog that I have a tendency to work on projects in
cycles. These cycles are work on games/work on financial projects. I have
noticed this in the past 2 years. I started working on chess related projects,
then the sudden crypto trading boom happened, and I started playing with
trading projects. Then the crypto market crashed and I became less interested
in the markets and started working on another TBS game. Now the Turkish Lira is
crashing and Iâ€™m once again interested in the markets. So this time I want to
make a project that analyzes US stocks and runs scanners on the price data to
generate signals. I want the system to be like twitter where you follow
companies and the signals appear in the companies timeline.</p>
<p>The architecture so far is pretty simple</p>
<p><img src="/img/stocktoot-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I get the stock data from IEX and cache it in Redis. N signal scanners will run
on this data to generate signals and the signal results are stored in MySQL.
There is a signal point system that is arbitrary at the moment. I assign a
multiplier and a adder value to each signal that I will use later to generate
the points. If the instruments generates signal points above a certain value it
will emit a signal.</p>
