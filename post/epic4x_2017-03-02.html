        <p>Today was another refactoring day. Some of the functionality regarding 
buildings and tiles was all cramped up into classes that dealt with planets, 
so I gave their own classes and endpoints. At first tiles and buildings are 
entities that are tied to planets so it kind of made sense to have them in a 
planet management service but then allocating a bean that would contain 
functionality only for tiles made the system more cohesive. I also made the 
API endpoints REST compliant in case there would be other clients in the 
future that would need to talk with it altough there are no such plans right 
now. It was one of those days when you get to really see the goods and bads 
of writing automated tests. The good is that you can be very confident in 
your refactors as you have tests to verify that you have not broken any 
functionality the bad is that when you refactor you also have to refactor 
some of the tests, especially when you change the interface of a class.</p>
