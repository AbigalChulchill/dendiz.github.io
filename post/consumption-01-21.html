        <h2>Investing legend James Simon's record won't be beat</h2>
<p>A nice article on how Renaissance technologies beat the market and the strategies they used to keep
the competitive advantage. It's interesting to know that they didn't allow investors to keep all their
money in the fund and had a forced profit distribution and thus keeping the money managed at the fund
at a certain level.</p>
<h2>That XOR trick</h2>
<p>A fun piece about how using XOR can accomplish little tricks such as in-place substitution
and figuring about the missing number or two in a list of sequential numbers.</p>
<h2>Your legacy database is outgrowing itself</h2>
<p>An insight into how chess.com restructured their database and application to accommodate for the
growth caused by people stuck at home in quarantine.</p>
<h2>Time of use, time of check (TOUTOC)</h2>
<p>An article in wikipedia that explains how race conditions can occur when code is checking for say
permission to a file and then based on the return code of a system call accessing that file. It turns
out that this problem is not at all trivial and easy to solve.</p>
<h2>Against essential and accidental complexity</h2>
<p>A reponse to Brooks claim in the 60's that tooling isn't going to make developers more productive.</p>
<h2>How and why I stopped buying laptops</h2>
<p>A look at why the old ThinkPads were the best machines around. I can resonate with this claim even though
I don't use one anymore.</p>
<h2>How to stop endless discussion</h2>
<p>An idea that writing documents (RFCs) stops the endless meetings with ambigious outcomes and forces the people
who are proposing the idea to be clear, concise and accountable for the idea.</p>
<h2>My year in data</h2>
<p>A wacko experiment of a data scientist who logged their life in 15 minute intervals. They came up with a couple
of different categories for their activities during the day and put then in an excel sheet. After a year they
drew some conclusions (like how does my leisure time vary over months, how much do I work, etc)</p>
