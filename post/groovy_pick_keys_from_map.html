        <p>one of the most common things you do when programming is transforming one representation of data to another.
here is a very common example:
say you have a map, say a result of a database query</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">def src = [id:1, name:'john', surname:'doe', password:'password', ccNumber1:'12312321']
</code></pre>
<p>and you wish to transform this into another map, but exclude some of the keys, and rename others.
A naive approach with tons of bloat is this</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">def result = [id: src.id, name:src.name, surname:src.surname, creditcard: src.ccNumber1]
</code></pre>
<p>for a few attributes, this looks ok, but if you have a lot it looks quite bad. Fortunately groovy
provides a very elegant method to convert in this situation. Here are 2 examples, first one if you
just want to pick keys, and the second one if you also want to rename the keys:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">def keys = ['id', 'name', 'surname']
keys.inject([:]) { acc,it -&amp;gt; acc + [ (it) : report[it] ] }
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">def keys = [id: 'id', ccNumber1: 'creditcard']
keys.inject([:]) {acc,it-&amp;gt; return acc + [ (it.value) : report[it.key] ] }
</code></pre>
<p>whats going on here is that we are starting off with an empty map, and iterating the keys
map/array. For every iteration we add the map to the accumulated map and move on.</p>
