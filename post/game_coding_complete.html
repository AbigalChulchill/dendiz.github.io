        <p>This book is aimed at taking a deeper dive into the neglected parts of game 
engine developerment such as asset loading management, event handling, caching 
and an architecturally sounds design. It does go throught the topics of 
rendering, scene graphs and the linear algebra behind 3D programming too but 
not at a great level of detail such as books that explain OpenGL. The APIs 
used in the book are DirectX and C++ and all the code examples are in that 
language. The book isn't using very advanced features of C++ and it is easy 
to follow along the example even if you don't know C++ (like I don't). 
I would say it's a good book that touches a broad set of topics regarding game
engine development but doesn't go into discussions on various implementations 
or details in those topics. Overall I would recommend it to anyone who is 
interested in game engine programming.</p>
