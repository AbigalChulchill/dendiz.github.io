        <h2>AirPods Max: An Audiophile Review</h2>
<p>An article that goes deep into what the AirPod Max has to offer - from the perspective of someone who has been in the industry for a decade. I was considering buying these so I went through the article. Has it changed my mind? Not yet, I’m still contemplating it as it's expensive.</p>
<h2>Amazon almost killed BestBuy</h2>
<p>A look into how BestBuy recovered from the retail attacks by Amazon and how their CEO was very effective during this phase and how he transformed the company.</p>
<h2>Building a personal data warehouse in Snowflake for fun and no profit.</h2>
<p>An article that goes through ingesting 30M HackerNews comments and using “SnowFlake” to analyze data to figure out when time to post a link etc.</p>
<h2>Parler’s epic fail: A crash course on running your own servers with a shoestring budget</h2>
<p>This post goes into how to host your homelab in a co-location space. The author takes you from procurement of used hardware to wiring it up in the datacenter.</p>
<h2>Seeking the productive life: Some details of my personal infrastructure</h2>
<p>A long article on Stephan Wolfram’s blog about how he manages his personal and work data and what he uses to accomplish this.</p>
<h2>The personal analytics of my Life</h2>
<p>Another article on Stephen Wolfram’s blog that details the analytics he has stored and the insights he has extracted from all the data he has collected over the years. It’s an interesting read but he doesn’t really mention any actionable items or how he used this data to make interesting changes/decisions.</p>
