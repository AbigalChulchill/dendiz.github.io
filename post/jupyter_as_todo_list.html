        <p>I have been working on moving all of my digital notes and blog to Jupyter and I'm really liking the flexible environment it is providing for me. I have completed the move of all my writings on my blog to Jupyter and wrote a publishing scripting (again in a Jupyter notebook) that even has a client side search engine.</p>
<p>The next thing to do (pun intended) was to move my to-do lists to Jupyter. For this I thought that I would have a single notebook (called very imaginatively <code>todo.ipynb</code>) and that every cell in the note book would represent something that I wanted to do. This is OK until you want to check off an item. I thought I'd just delete the completed items but I don't like throwing away things I spent time writing so I wanted a way to mark them as complete, then eventually move to an archive so they don't clutter the main notebook. The best way I could think of this was to add <code>todo</code> tag to the item. If the items is pending it has the <code>todo</code> tag if it's not then it's done. I might actually convert this to be the other way around where if the item does not have a tag it's a <code>todo</code> and then add a <code>done</code> tag when it's done. The reason for this is that it's easy to forget to add the tag when you add a new item.</p>
<p><a href="attachment:todolist-fs8.png">todolist-fs8.png</a></p>
<p>This tagging method makes it kind of OK to work with items but there is still a lot of clutter because completed items are intertwined with pending items. I was using the down and up arrow to move the cells but that's a lot of clicking when you have a lot of to-do items and there is no &quot;send to bottom&quot; button. So I wrote a small script that does this for me. It traverses the notebook and moves cells with no <code>todo</code> tag to the end of the list, adds a <code>done</code> tag (which is used by the archiving script) and also adds a green text to indicate that it's done. Guess what that text reads? Yes, &quot;done&quot;.</p>
<p>The script can the triggered from a python cell in the to-do notebook which is convenient but requires a reload because it modifies the notebook.</p>
<p>I also have a script that I added as a scheduled job that moves the completed items in the to-do notebook to an archive notebook once a week to reduce clutter. The archive notebooks are per month.</p>
<p>It's not always easy to add an item to your list when you are not in front of a computer or not at home (I don't open my homelab to the outside world) so I added another script that monitors an email  account and creates to-do items from the email.</p>
