        <p>I’ve been looking into rogue like games and the generation of levels done 
using procedural generation is something that I found to be interesting. 
A book on the subject edited by the creator of dwarf fortress look like a 
good read so I got it from Amazon on May 28, 2020 for 50$ as a hard copy. 
The book is a compilation of articles ranging from some what procedural 
generation is and isn’t to the ethics in the output of the generated content.
It’s an interesting read though nothing that is too enlightening.</p>
<p>There is only one chapter that provides some pseudo-code about the idea but the
rest of the chapters are more around discussions and ideas in PCG. So if you are
looking for implementations of PCG techniques look else where.</p>
