        <p>I got a rack last year for my birthday and it's been sitting there kind of empty. I installed a 24 port switch (which is way overkill) and 2 shelves. Itâ€™s been housing my fanless micro pc box, a small Synology NAS and a laptop with the lid closed on one of the shelves. Itâ€™s blasphemy to own a rack and use it as a cabinet but I just didnâ€™t have the time or energy to do the research and get a rack mount server.. Until now. There are an abundant amount of used servers on Amazon and Ebay but I donâ€™t think I can put up with furnace level sounds in my small office so I went ahead and built a PC that is basically rack mounted. This hardware isnâ€™t mission critical so I donâ€™t actually need server grade hardware even though itâ€™s running 24/7.</p>
<p>So I went on Amazon and compiled mid level components to keep the cost and noise down. I got</p>
<ul>
<li>ASRock B450M PRO4 AM4 AMD mobo</li>
<li>Ryzen 5 5600g</li>
<li>64gb RAM</li>
<li>1tb NAND SSD</li>
<li>Rosewill rackmount chassis</li>
<li>Noctua low profile silent CPU cooler</li>
<li>3 x 80mm silent Noctua case fans</li>
</ul>

<p>My main concern was building a silent computer so I got a 2U rack for better airflow and kept the CPU a mid-range one. Noctua fans are essential here as the fans that come out of the box are pretty loud. I still havenâ€™t installed the 3 80mm fans from Noctua but with the silent CPU cooler and default case fans Iâ€™m getting around 45-50db noise levels which is acceptable. I expect this to get down to the 30s with the new fans.</p>
<p>The build itself took me about 4 hours to complete. The case is very tight and there is not a lot of room to maneuver in there. I could not remove the center disk housing because of a screw that just would not come off. I have seen screws that turn but do not go in but it's the first time I have seen a screw that turns but doesn't come out ðŸ™ƒ. Another hiccup was the installation of the CPU cooler which had a mounting plate that is installed on the rear side of the motherboard so I had to uninstall it and attach the plate and reinstall.</p>

<p>Migrating the services went smoothly. I keep everything as a docker container so I just had to copy over the volumes and directories. I switched from CGit (which consumes low resources) to Gitea and I had to manually organize and import some of the repos. The main reason for the switch is the built-in mirroring and issue tracking. I also ditched Laminar CI for Jenkins now that I have more resources for the convenience. I will also use this machine as a TechScan machine once the program is ready.</p>
