        <h1>Quick Intro</h1>
<p>PIPE is a small javascript framework for building ajax enabled application using a declarative syntax and minimal amount of javascript code. It works by splitting the application pages into fragments that have attributes that define the view model and behavior of the fragment. Installation is very easy, just include pipe.js in your HTML and the dependencies underscore.js and jquery and you are good to go. PIPE will run automatically after the document is loaded and work its magic.</p>
<h1>Details</h1>
<p><a href="http://deniz.dizman.org/img/pipejs-fragment.png">http://deniz.dizman.org/img/pipejs-fragment.png</a></p>
<p>The diagram above shows components of a list application. We can divide this application into the following parts</p>
<ul>
<li>A collection of lists, that show which lists the user has created.</li>
<li>The items in the selected list.</li>
<li>The details of the item selected.</li>
<li>Comments on the selected item.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these components load a different view, have different behaviors, and refresh them selves on certain events. For example the comment component should refresh its self after the user has posted a comment, but the list collection need not refresh its self. This is what ajax applications are all about, just refreshing the required parts of the page, and leaving the rest alone, therefore providing a faster and smoother user experience. These components are called &quot;fragments&quot; in PIPE terminology. PIPE provides a framework of managing the lifecycles of these fragments, by loading and unloading them or refreshing them whenever there are data changes. It does so by making the user write only a minimal amount of javascript. The user can declare the behavir of the fragment by assigning special attributes in the markup.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look on these fragments (the following examples are all available on the example application on github):</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;div class=&quot;span3&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div id=&quot;listbox&quot; fragment-url=&quot;/partial/listbox&quot; watch=&quot;/lists/add&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is the code for the listbox - the collection of the lists - from the file <code>home.html.php</code> which is the users home screen after login. The <code>div</code> is the container for the fragment. Let's check out the attributes:</p>
<h1>fragment-url</h1>
<p>This attribute defines the URL that PIPE will request to inject into the container. When the page is loaded PIPE will scan all the <code>div</code>s in the markup and find the fragment containers. Then an ajax GET request will be sent to these fragment URL in parallel. If a fragment is dependent on another fragment, you should embed the dependent fragment into the other fragments markup. PIPE will resolve the dependencies and load them in serial mode.</p>
<h1>watch</h1>
<p>This attribute defines a watcher URL which is used to notify the fragment that data has been updated and that it should load its self. PIPE will scan all fragments and register any watch URLs that a fragment contains. The URL is a regular expression so multiple URLs or wild card URLs may be defined using the javascript regular expression syntax. After an ajax request to the watch URL is completed, PIPE will refresh all the fragments with this watch URL, which means a request will be made to the fragment-url and the result will be injected into the container.</p>
<h1>Params</h1>
<p>This attribute defines any extra parameters that need to be sent to the fragment url as GET parameters. This enables interaction between fragments. For example in the lists application, when a user selects a list in the list box, the list item display fragment must be aware of which list to load. This can be done by passing parameters to the fragment url indicating which list to load. This attribute can also be manipulated using the javascript API of PIPE with the methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>PIPE.addParam</li>
<li>PIPE.removeParam</li>
<li>PIPE.setParams</li>
<li>PIPE.getParams</li>
</ul>
<p>The attribute is stored as a query string, although the javascript API manipulates it as a JSON object.</p>
<h1>Disabled</h1>
<p>If this attribute is set to &quot;disabled&quot; PIPE will skip loading this fragment. This is usefull for just placing the container in the markup for future use. The example application uses this to show the details of the selected item. Until an item is selected from the list, it doesn't make sense to have the details item fragment loaded.</p>
<h1>Unload</h1>
<p>This attribute is used to empty the content of the fragment container on certain requests. This attribute acts exactly the same as the watch attribute, except that instead of refreshing the fragment, it will empty it. The example application uses this to empty the item details fragment, when an item is deleted.</p>
<h1>Routes</h1>
<p>PIPE also provides a javascript API under the PIPE namespace. PIPE can act as a router for binding functions to the location hash. This is a very simple way of adding behaviour to your elements. The syntax is very simple and can be seen in the <code>lists.js</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>    PIPE.register(&quot;#!/list/:id/filter/:filter&quot;, function(id,filter) {
        ....
    });
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>:id</code> and <code>:filter</code> are named parameters, meaning that any portion that matches the pattern will be given to the function as an argument. When the location hash matches this filter, the function gets executed. For example the URL</p>
<pre><code>    http://localhost/home/#!/lists/6/filter/incomplete
</code></pre>
<p>will execute the function with the parameters 6 and &quot;incomplete&quot; respectively.</p>
<h1>PIPE.load</h1>
<p>After certain user actions, you may need to reload a fragment with adjusted parameters. Using the PIPE parameter manipulation functions and PIPE.load this is possible. An example is displaying the item details. The registered function for the item display URL gets the list id, and item id from the named parameters and reloads the item detail fragment using the javascript API. Multiple requests made to the same fragment are queued and only the newest content will be injected into the container</p>
