        <p>Today I came across an interesting algorithm for selecting the K smallest 
numbers from a list of unsorted numbers. This was in direct relation to part 
of the warp lane generation algorithm I was using (MST+N closest) so I thought
I’d convert my current nlogn to this new nlogk algorithm*. It won’t matter 
to much for small galaxies but should improve performance for larger galaxies.
Another issue that was bothering me was the integration tests were taking a 
long time due to their nature of starting and stopping the context. Also 
IDEA cannot generate test coverage reports from these tests so I wrote unit
tests with mock for the planet service at 88% coverage. I plan to write this
type of tests for the rest of the service and logic classes and reduce the
number of integration tests – or at least not write more for the time being.</p>
