        <p>I've been looking into reading more fiction books and what better place to start than sci-fi. I actually came across this series when I was browsing the Aurora 4x game forums trying to get an idea behind what inspired Steve Whimsley to create the game. Anyways the Honor Harrington books were recommended reading so and since the first book in the series was free for the Kindle I got it. It's a long book with 32 chapters and 422 pages but the it's very easy reading. The language is simple and the chapters flow. It took me about 6 weeks to finish the book as I tried to read a chapter every evening. The characters and the relations between the characters are described in detail and the reader can empathize and understand them. There aren't too many characters so things don't get complicated. One thing I would have liked to see would have been more epic ship to ship battles and more introduction into the physics and technology of the era. I had to refer to a wiki to get an understanding of what they were talking about.</p>
<p>All in all I enjoyed reading the book and will continue with the rest of the series.</p>
