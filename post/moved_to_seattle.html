        <p>So the last 2 years I’ve been going back an forth between Pittsburgh and Istanbul every couple of months to visit my wife who was getting her MBA at the Tepper school of business at Carnegie Mellon University. This year she has graduated and has accepted a job offer from a Seattle company and we made the move to Seattle beginning of June after having my parents and the in-laws visit us in Pittsburgh for 10 days (lots of great places seen during their visit for 10 days, but that’s a whole different story). The plan before moving here was to stay at a hotel for a week while we were apartment hunting. I went online to booking.com to find a hotel. Hotels in Seattle are quite expensive since we wanted to stay near residential areas close to down town because our car wouldn’t arrive until a couple of days in. I found the best solution was to rent an “apartel” from Ginosi. This is basically a 1 bedroom apartment in a building. After a 7 hour flight from Pittsburgh when we arrived at the apartel and let our selves in we were pleasantly surprised as it only had 10 reviews on booking.com but a high rating. The place was called “Puget Indigo” and was located at 4th Ave. and Republican West. We arrived late sunday evening so just had to go straight to the apartment with 4 huge pieces of luggage and 3 backpacks and just call it a day. The next was memorial day so all the leasing offices were closed. We spent the day on zillow.com looking for places and reading reviews and social statistics about different neighborhoods like Queen Anne, Ballard, Belltown etc. We decided to assign a day for each neighborhood and Tuesday was Queen Anne day. We had heard good things about this place so it was a priority . B. made an excel sheet with all the places we wanted to see in Queen Anne (roughly 8 places) that matched our criteria. So the first place turned out to be an apartment in the building we were staying at! That was quite funny because we just took the elevator 2 floors down to meet the leasing specialist which took us back to the 4th floor and showed us the place. The location of the building was OK but there were renovations going on at the building and it was the first place we saw so we didn’t really have anything to compare with. The next place we went to see was a condo in upper Queen Anne. The apartment was located on a very nice street with lots of houses with gardens, very residential. But you had to take 2 flights of stairs to reach the building entrance, and 2 more to reach the apartment. This was something I didn’t like having lived at places like that for years. The apartment was small and the bathrooms were old  –- no go.</p>
<p>The next place was Tarmigan located at 14th Ave W and W Boston St. This was a 2 bedroom loft with a huge volume due to high ceilings and all but it was old and the appliances looked like they were from the 80’s. The best thing to do with that place would be to buy, tear it down and rebuild it.</p>
<p>Next up was Metro on First located at John St. and 1st Ave. W. The building looked very nice from the outside with julliet patios and architecture resemblant of European style. The main entrance has a small fountain outside and a small garden. I loved how the building looked from the outside. We met with the leasing specialist and she showed us the apartment. It was great! 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms. A living room with a great view!</p>

<p>Just for the sake of being the devils advocate I insisted that we see a couple of more places after we saw this apartment even though I really liked it. It was around 3pm and our next appointment was at 7 pm so we went back to the hotel to plan the next day.  10 minutes after we started look at houses in Belltown I said “this is useless, I really liked Metro on First. Let’s pull the trigger on that one”. And so here we are living in lower Queen Anne, Seattle.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to decorate a new house from scratch for the 3rd time.</p>
