        <p>spark java is a micro framework inspired by sinatra for java. It’s a really cool substitute for spring mvc which is a drag to because it takes so much time to boot the framework. 
I’ve been giving spark a go on a few projects (see: pads ) and I am quite pleased with the results. The new version also supports java 8 and has a lot of improvements over the 1.1.1 version. 
A problem that I came across using spark was during file uploads. Spark uses an embedded jetty server and the servlet 3.0 spec which requires @MultipartConfig on servlets that handle file uploads. Since spark is using handlers and you dreally don’t want to configure servlets and a web.xml fileuploading needs a work around which is rather simple. On the handler that is going to process the file upload just add these lines:</p>
<pre><code>public Object handle(Request request, Response response) {
   MultipartConfigElement multipartConfigElement = new MultipartConfigElement(&quot;/tmp&quot;);
   request.raw().setAttribute(&quot;org.eclipse.multipartConfig&quot;, multipartConfigElement);
   ....
   Part file = request.raw().getPart(&quot;file&quot;); //file is name of the upload form

</code></pre>
<p>the parameter to MultiparConfig is the location for the temporary uploaded file.</p>
