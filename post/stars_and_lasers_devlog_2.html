        <p>Ok I made some progress in getting adding the correct player activation method. 
I was locked in on just selecting a random ship from the available ships in the 
grid but the correct thing was to have a weighted probability from the existing 
ships for each side to decide the winner of the roll and have the player choose 
which ship to activate. This also lead the way to start a new turn 
(if the weight total is 0 all ships have played).</p>
<p>I added a stupid AI class as a place holder so that I could complete the turn 
sequence related work. The rule book actually has a simple rule based AI 
description which I could add and have semi-playable game.</p>
<p>No changes with regards to the UI so Iâ€™m not adding any new screenshots or 
videos.</p>
