        <h1 id="title"> A simple solution to the Monty Hall problem</h1>
        <div id="date"><em> 2015-07-16</em></div>
        <div class="content">
        <p>The Monty Hall problem is an interesting probability question that people have a hard time understanding the solution. The problem is this: You are on a TV show and the there are 3 closed doors. Behind one of the doors is a brand new car, and behind the two other doors there is a goat. Obviously you want the car. So you make a choice. The door you chose remains closed but one of the other doors are opened and a goat is revealed (always). Now you are asked the following question: Would you like to change the door you selected, or stay with your initial selection? What should you do? does it even matter?</p>
<p>I've asked this question to a few people and all of them thought that it didn't matter. I had a hard time explaining to them that it did, until I saw this table which explains it all so nicely</p>
<p>In the table stay means choose door 1 and stay with your choice, change means choose 1 but change.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>door 1</th>
  <th>door 2</th>
  <th>door 3</th>
  <th>stay</th>
  <th>change</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>car</td>
  <td>goat</td>
  <td>goat</td>
  <td>cat</td>
  <td>goat</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>goat</td>
  <td>cat</td>
  <td>goat</td>
  <td>goat</td>
  <td>car</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>goat</td>
  <td>goat</td>
  <td>cat</td>
  <td>goat</td>
  <td>car</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>so you can see that unless you picked the car on your initial pick, you will get a goat 2/3 times if you don't change. The reason is that Monty always reveals the door with a goat behind it and of course never your selected door. Such a nice example of a table as a data visualization tool being useful.</p>
