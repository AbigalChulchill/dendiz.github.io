        <h1 id="title"> Installing Automatic outside the USA</h1>
        <div id="date"><em> 2015-05-31</em></div>
        <div class="content">
        <p>automatic is a nice little gadget that will collect information about your car from the ODB port (available in almost all cars) and combine that with the GPS on the phone to give you a nice summary of your drives. This all sounded great and I ordered one immediately but there is one catch: Automatic only supports vehicles in the US. But this wasn't going to stop me from using it! Here are the step I took to get my automatic working.</p>
<h3>App installation</h3>
<p>First of all when I did a search for automatic in the google play store, I got back silly results. None of them were the automatic app I was looking for. So I found the exact play store link from their web site, and to my dismay the app could not be installed on devices outside of the US. So the first thing to do is to find the APK (the so called archive for and android app, like an exe for windows) for the android client. After a couple of hours searching I was able to find the 1.5 version of the client (35mb). I had no luck with the evozi tool, I'm uploading my version of the client for others to download it. Once you have to file, just copy it on to your device via a USB cable and run it from the device. Use the file manager to locate the file on your phone and just click it. This will install the automatic app.</p>
<p>update: If you are an IOS user, you can download the app by switching the app store country/region to the US. You will need a US credit card or an iTunes gift card. If you have a friend from the US who trusts you enough you can also login with their account to download the app and then logout.</p>
<h3>Dongle installation</h3>
<p>I had no problems installing the dongle on my car. Just locate the ODB port and plugin the device in firmly. It will beep once it's in place and follow the on screen instructions on the phone. You need bluetooth and an internet connection. I had to restart the pairing process a few times because it would not discover the device. But I got it to work after a few tries. When the application is done pairing it will get the VIN from the dongle and will fail because your cars wasn't made/sold in the US, but the application will let you enter a VIN manually. I open a VIN generator and created a random VIN. You can find a VIN generator site here. Just generate a VIN until you get one starting with a 1 or an A. I got a 2011 Jeep Renegade for the VIN that was generated for me. After you input this VIN automatic will start logging your trips.</p>
