So after a couple days of saving up features to write on the dev log, here is
what’s been happening:</p>
<p>I cleaned up the command processing architecture and added event/state based
hooks, so now each command has a pre-execute, execute and post execute stage 
that is called.</p>
<p>Setup/tear down tasks are be done at the pre/post stages and the execution phase 
does it’s magic. I also added validation for command→components mappings. 
So you can’t go around trying to issue a move command to a ship that doesn’t have
an engine.</p>
<p>Issuing move commands can get confusing when there are 30.000 planets to choose from. 
The empires will have the location of all stars in the galaxy but they still need
to survey the system to get specifics. Ships now have a sensor component that will
limit the range it can navigate.</p>
<p>I also tidied up the parameters being passed to the endpoints using the great
spring provided argument resolvers. This makes the controller layer code so
much cleaner, a pleasure to work with. I also went ahead and restructured the 
package layout by functionality instead of application layers. There is no best
practice for this so I’m trying out this type of structuring.</p>
<p>Now that the backend processing for commands is in place, the client needed 
some attention. The client is a prototype but still it needs a nice way to
enable command input. Also the current command queue of the ships are listed.</p>
<p>I was using random string generator for names which gets a bit complicated when
looking at planet/star names for navigation so I thought I’d code a small 
Markov chain based name generator for stars, planets and ships. 
Now I get names like the Heliak System, Coltar IV, Otein III and ships called 
Siberty. Sometimes it does spit out weird names that sound like elven too though.</p>
<p>I also setup the QA server with automated deployments so that I can have friends 
do some play testing, even though it’s still too early for that.</p>
<p>I merged the info requests that were made periodically into a single request to
reduce server load going forward.</p>
