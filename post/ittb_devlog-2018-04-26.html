<ul>
<li>bug fixes</li>
<li>loot generation</li>
</ul>
<p>I had implemented the duplicates check for the spawn queue in a inefficient
way, so I corrected that. No need to scan the queue every time, just keep track
of the element in the queue in a set. I also realized during test playing that
newly spawned water tiles could lead to islands in the map. So a check for
connectivity was needed before adding that new water tile to the queue. This
lead me to fix a performance issue in the connectivity checking code. A split
the tile-tile checking code from the slower building – tile checking code. I’m
still not sure if I should let water tiles spawn on building tiles. This is
frustrating for the player because most of the time there is nothing you can do
to stop it. It’s simply not possible to kill the remaining enemies in the
number of turn given to save the building and this does reduce the global
building preservation count. On the other hand it does make the game a bit more
difficult and exciting.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago I had noticed that some enemies froze occasionally.
Investigation into this led me to discover that it was possible for the enemies
to select a building/mountain tile as the location for an attack on the player
in some configurations. I implemented a fix for this and also implemented a fix
for selecting unreachable tiles. I’m wondering if I should just let the enemies
do a random walk if they don’t get a movement tile or just let them sit frozen
for a couple of turns?</p>
<p>During one test game I was blessed (!) with a mech that had 5 speed. This made
it super easy to go around killing all the enemies very fast before a wave came
in to their rescue. After progressing about 5 levels the game crashed with a
NPE because the level generator could not place the number of required units on
the deployment zone for the enemies. There just wasn’t enough free tiles!. What
this means is this</p>
<ul>
<li>The weapon/item generation system is flawed. Why would I get a +5 speed mech
in the first level?</li>
<li>Not just more enemies each level, we also need stronger enemies.</li>
<li>There has to be a trade-off between speed, weapon strength, range.</li>
</ul>
<p>These were issues I was previously aware of, and had in my to do list. The
solution is a points system which measures the strength of the units and
adjusts the level difficulty based on this.</p>
<p>Also I’m thinking of introducing a weight and maybe a heat system to implement
the trade off between items. To install an AC with +2 damage means your speed
is reduced by 1. So if you have a mech that’s only speed 1 you can’t install
that weapon. With the current setup of only 1 item per mech this also means
that if can’t have armor + speed. So if your mechs initial speed is 1 you
cannot have AC2 + armor which may have a negative effect on game play.</p>
<p>I also saw an issue where the supports unit would surround a normal enemy unit
and would not budge effectively freezing that unit in place. I set an upper
limit of 1 for support units on the map.  Now that the unit lab development is
complete and we can equip the units with items and weapons things are looking a
lot better. We also implemented a budgeting system for generating the weapon
stats based on level. Each level you get a budget of say 5 units and this
budget is distributed randomly to the stats of the loot being generated. This
type of generation also brought a balance to the game. No more Bruce Lee’ing
around the map killing everybody.</p>
