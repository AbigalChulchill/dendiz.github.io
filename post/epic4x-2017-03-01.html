The gui got some love today with the addition of a button that says “+building” 
that will start the construction of a building on a surface tile. I also 
cleaned up some messy code on the server side that was related to storing 
some definitions about building cost, maintenance, construction time etc. 
With the construction of buildings comes the destruction of buildings too. 
I also fixed an annoying bug where the population relocation box would be 
populated with tiles that were already occupied. I’m thinking of a gui that 
will allow the players to nagivate without using a galaxy map. I checked out
some o-game screenshots and never saw a galactic map so I suspect that is
possible but I’m not sure if it would have an adverse impact on playability.</p>
