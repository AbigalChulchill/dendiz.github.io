        <h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI, movement</li>
<li>movement animations</li>
</ul>
<p>over the last 2 days the AI got a lot of attention. Moving to random tiles with in the range
was annoying anyway so I implemented a target selection algorithm. The basics are the same 
for the algorithm I had used in the prototype. Pick the closest building based on euclidean
distance and go towards that. This type of target selection may sometimes lead to what would
seem as non optimal. Such as the case</p>
<pre><code>. . . . .
1 x . @ .
. x . . .
. x . . .
. x . . .
. . . . .
. . . 2 .
</code></pre>
<p>@ = player</p>
<p>1 = target</p>
<p>2 = target</p>
<p>x = blocker</p>
<p>Here the closest target is 1 based on euclidean distance, when in fact the path to that target
is way longer than the path to target 2.</p>
<p>But “optimal” is not what I’m searching for. It’s OK to make the game unpredictable at times,
so it doesn’t get boring. After the target selection, I added the ability to show a target indication
for enemies. This is actually a ‘threat’ indication as the attack will happen next turn. The enemies
stay committed to the direction they are attacking if they lock on to a target and will attack
in that direction if they are pushed/pulled or dislodged some other way. I also added the force move
and it’s damage effects on the units. I realized that if a weapon can do more than 1 tile force move
the code has to be in the movement class, as the damage effects need to be applied after the animation
to that tile is complete. This lead to the need for separating the movement animation code from the 
movement class into a separate component. I also needed to add a “Fly” method that doesn’t check if
the path to a target node contains blockers, as I want the unit to crash into the blockers. While at
it I also changed the way the movement animations were done. Previously I was LERP’ing the movement 
between the tiles, which lead to a movement that gradually sped up when it was getting near to it’s 
target. Now I just use a simple method to calculate the amount to move and animate the movement in a
linear fashion, which made the animations look better. The idea is quite simple, I don’t know why I
didn’t do it in the first place:</p>
<pre><code>distance = Speed * Time.deltaTime //distance to travel this frame
dir = target.position - my.position
if (dir.magnitude &gt; distance) {
  translate(dir.normalized * distance)
} else {
  my.position = target.position
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also added an in game console, which I use for messages as the unity Debug.Log sucks.</p>
