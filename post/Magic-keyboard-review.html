        <div id="date"><em> 2021-09-02</em></div>
        <div class="content">
        <p>I tried to resist for a long time, tried to use my 15&quot; laptop but it's just not the same. I tried cheap keyboards with track pads from amazon but that was not the same either. So when I got an unexpected budget for spending due to some life events, I decided to go for it an get the magic keyboard for the 12.9&quot; iPad.</p>
<p>The feel of the keys are great. It's missing the f keys and an escape key but that's ok. I was thinking the escape key would be an issue in vim but I've gotten used to the <code>ctrl+[</code> pretty quick. The track pad is really good, precise and no lagging at all. This makes all the difference compared to the cheaper keyboards out there.</p>
<p>The magnetic attachment system is good, makesit very easy to detach the device for tablet use. The angels of usage are very limited though, so if you want a steep angel or fold the device back completely, that's not going to happen.</p>
<p>another topic I was worried about was the stability while using it on my lap. On a table it's great, just like a laptop but what happens on an uneven surface like a pairof legs? Well once you find your balance it's pretty decent. Finding that balance does't take long either so I'm pretty happy with the way everything turned out.</p>
