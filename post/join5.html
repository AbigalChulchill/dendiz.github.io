        <p>Join5 is my first game with the godot engine. I did the logic programming (path finding, undo, joker supported ball destroys, etc) and a friend of mine did the graphics and GUI related programming. The game is a match-N type of game similar but a bit different than the old game I used to play on Gnome called &quot;the same game&quot;.</p>
<p>The development including the GFX and SFX took about a month to complete working on average 3hrs/day on this. It did look like a superficial and simple game to implement but interesting cases did appear after we decided to add a joker colored ball.</p>
