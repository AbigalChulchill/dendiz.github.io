        <p>It’s been quite a while since I wrote a devlog, and quite a lot has happened in
the project in between. I’ll try to merge the stuff from the commit logs and
stuff I posted on mastodon to give an overview. I’ve been coding the scanner
for most of the month. We consolidated the scanner into categories, with some
constraints on the combinator based on categories, so that you don’t have 2
scanners of the same category combined. Also you don’t want bullish/bearish
scanner combinations. There are 70 scanners and it’s hell to have to change
anything on the scanner interface. I’ve partially solved this problem by
extending the scanners from an abstract class, but for a feature called
parameter customization I still have to go over almost all scanners and add
their default parameters. I’ve also encountered a lot of performance issues
with scanner performance calculations. Doing the calculation based on last
years data took quite a while when I was using the scan results from the
database, so I decided to truncate the scan results kept in the database to a
months worth of data, and do all scanner runs on a years worth of data online
during the scanner performance calculations. Less DB round trips increased the
performance.  There was also an issue that ran into a sort of N select problem,
where the DB was queried in each iteration of the loop. I fixed this by using
an IN query to get all the stuff I needed before going into the loop.</p>
<p>I had started using MongoDB for raw data such as OHLCV data and scanner
results, but I decided to get everything into MySQL as complex queries on
MongoDB are a pain. So I got rid of MongoDB for all modules in the project.  I
have a couple of ideas for parameter recommendations for indicators based on
the indicators values. I actually wanted to brute-force my way though some
parameter combos to find the best scoring combo for that symbol and indicator
but that leads to an unmanagable number of scans. Now I will try to recommend
RSI/Stoch overbought/oversold parameters based on the number that actually was
used as the turning point in the charts.</p>
<p>There was progress on the web client as well. I setup a nice continuous
integration server that deploys all pushed commits and I also setup my router
with DynDNS and port forwarding so that the team can use the test environment.
I re-purposed my workstation as a Proxmox host (something I had already done
before) and I’m using my laptop as my workstation now. This kind of sucks
because it’s a weak weak machine. I don’t really want to spend money on a new
work station right now, as I have received my EAD and I’m planning to start
working somewhere after I get this project live. So back to the web client, we
have the main page almost setup, but since nobody in the team is a designer or
has any background related to design it doesn’t look professional to me. This
could be just a bias, I’m not sure. I put out the idea of paying someone to
design it, but it wasn’t received well – probably because we can’t visualize
what we want and cannot really tell the designer what he should do. The pricing
page, login and registration pages exists and are functional, but not really
tested. Testing and product management is a weak point in the team.</p>
<p>So, product management for this project is actually quite simple: I expect wire
frames, use cases, and some testing from our PM.  He has no experience, but I
just can’t understand why somebody can’t simple research all this stuff and do
it. I have to step in at almost every step, and this is slowing us down and
demotivating me, as I don’t want to do this – that’s the point of having a
product manager.</p>
<p>I’ve set a tight deadline to go live, per peter principle I want to keep
everybody on their toes, but my current status on this is yellow, that’s why
I’m also working on a B plan. The opportunity cost is just too high now that I
have the EAD.</p>
