        <p>Most of the people around me in all kinds of different domains of work, usually complain about how boring / mundane their jobs are and are demotivated and probably hate getting up in the morning and going to work. There are also the &quot;lucky&quot; kind of people that despite doing the same thing year after year either are not bored or are bored but don't mind the boredom. If there are really not bored, which I find incomprehensible - that's fine. If they are bored but don't have the will power to change it then there is not much I could recommend. But there are also the kind that want to change but don't know how it's possible. I probably would fall into this category. At it's core what you do as a software engineer is read/write and process data. One way or another be it be database manipulations, video/image manipulations or something else. Different domains require different optimizations on the way of manipulating the data. For example some could require efficient usage of memory, others may require fault tolerance or speed. And for most of the people out there nobody is inventing a new wheel. We are just implementing already defined solutions to our problem. This can get boring extremely fast. Although I do not have any experience as a professional in other disciplines, I believe it's not wrong to interpolate that the same goes for jobs. It's the same rinse and repeat cycle day after day and for people with creative minds this can be a torturing experience. This is one of the main reasons I believe that the turn-over rate in the IT industry is above average (http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/career-management/tech-companies-have-highest-turnover-rate/). So what can be done to make your job challenging and fun? What drives those who are creative but yet still manage to do amazing stuff without getting bored? Those who everybody looks at with envy and wishes they had that job? What I came to realize is that the kind of people that consistently seek new challenges will satisfy this by either letting go of the current position, or by progressing in a different area. This doesn't mean that you have solved or out grown the task at hand, it just means that you are no longer satisfied in general with doing the similar stuff day after day. An example would be for a database programmer to explore the field of 3D graphics and games. There are new unexplored problems in that domain that you can relate to and solving these problems or researching them broadens your perspective. The moment you can adapt the methods used in that field to your field of expertise you've hit the jackpot. This can be a moment of a truly unique discovery or invention or just a satisfying &quot;aha&quot; moment. But whatever it is it will make your brain flood with endorphins and make you feel good. A lot of inventions ranging from machinery to algorithms were made by mimicking nature! A completely unrelated field to both computer science and engineering in general. It is highly likely that some guy who was a keen observer and a creative type and possibly had an ant farm one day had a lightning bolt idea of mimicking the techniques used by ants to optimize their food search and adapting these techniques to calculate optima in general CS problems - Ant swarm optimization was born. Yngwie Malmsteen is a great electric guitar virtuoso but if he is the type of guy I'm talking about I bet he would be bored sick with all his songs and albums, because they basically very similar. On the other hand Pink Floyd who is infamous for experimenting with drugs brings a whole new experience to their music. They are incorporating different aspects from different experiences into their music not to get boring. The 1970s version of top gear was just like any other car show. That's why it was boring and eventually went off-air. The new version of top gear has so many different themes in it ranging from comedy to challenges to other ridiculous stuff but that's what made the show a huge success and interesting. Adapting aspects from totally different areas into your own area or domain makes things interesting and worth while.</p>
