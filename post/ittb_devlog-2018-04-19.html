        <p>test playing the new turn based tower defense game which I have not yet dubbed
and shall refer to as TBTD for short I came to the conclusion that levels were
too easy. Adding more enemies is the first thing that popped into my mind but
that doesn’t make the game interesting, it only makes it tedious. In the first
round of the prototype I had the targeting set to all neighbor tile at a
distance of 1 tile.</p>
<p>So diagonal attacks were possible. Changing this rule to only cardinal
directions increased the difficulty quite a bit. Also I came up with the
following mechanic: The player has 2 types of attacks. Ranged and melee. If you
are standing next to an enemy you default to a melee attack.</p>
<p>You cannot use a ranged attack. If you are not next to the enemy it’s a ranged
weapon attack (if you have one). Since ranged attack will not displace the
enemy it becomes a tactical decision to use a ranged attack and keep you Mech
safe or go up to the enemy to displace it. This did add a variety to the
tactical decision needed. GO refactored the attack code into a weapons class,
so we have the foundation to add different types of weapons into the game.</p>
<p>The pilot weapons are the Punch and Auto-cannon with different damages /
ranges.</p>
<p>As the turns progress new enemies spawn. The current method for doing this is a
probabilistic method and the chances to spawn an enemy increase with each turn
that an enemy is not spawn. If an enemy does spawn, the chance reduces. So if
the game drags on your chances of clearing the level decrease quite a bit which
forces the player to act quickly. I’m also thinking of adding a turn counter to
make some levels survival mode levels.</p>
<p>One feedback I got was that the levels become repetitive after a certain while,
especially if there is going to be the concept of permanent death, which I
actually find appealing. Random level generation is out of the question as
random is random, and not nice to play. So going through some procedural level
content designs, I came up with the idea of constructing the levels in chunks.
Each level consists of a combination of 4 chunks to choose from N.</p>
<p>This can yield different level topology and game play. We’ll need to test this
to see how it goes.</p>
<p>We discussed the concept of salvaging enemies at the end of each level
(looting) for better weapons and upgrades. This also looks like a promising
mechanic.</p>
<p>For this to be meaningful, I will also need to implement some kind of
procedural weapon generator which I need look into.</p>
