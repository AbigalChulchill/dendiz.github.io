        <p>I was pretty reluctant to get the Airpod Max’s even with my discount. I have never spent that much money on headphones and the thought of it just put me off. I went to the apple store to get something unrelated and had the opportunity to try them out. I’m not an audiophile or a music snob, but I do listen to music 6-8 hours every week day and have been playing an instrument for 20+ years. I recall doing this musical IQ test for some university online and got an average score. I also did a test where you listen to different samples recorded in different quality and didn’t really do well on it. Later a friend of mine who is a self proclaimed audiophile proved to me that equipment really does make a difference and the reason why I scored ⅗ on that test was equipment. I was given a beats solo 3 when I first started working at my current company but those cans got destroyed after 1.5 years of use. I was absolutely shocked as I do take care of my stuff. So I was in the market for some wireless headphones and the AirPod Max just came out. So at the store I put them on and fired up Apple music to try out the sample songs. And, yeah it sounded great. The noise cancelling was sublime, it was as if everybody just disappeared and I was alone in that store. I then searched for a song that I knew well to really understand what the device could deliver. It had crystal clear highs, great mids and beefy bass. Not overpowering but easy to distinguish all the notes the bass was playing and each kick drum note. I tried fooling around with the spatial audio stuff but wasn’t too interested in that. So I think the sound and the quality of music that flows is great, 5 stars would buy again.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed as many others have pointed out is that the device is pretty heavy. I thought that would not be a problem as I’m not planning on being mobile while wearing it but after about 6 months of owning it my ears do feel the fatigue of carrying that extra weight some days. When I do get tired I switch to my Sony MDR1A or Audio Technica ATH50x headphones which probably weigh less than a half of the AirPod Max.</p>
<p>Another downside is that wireless, while convenient , does not perform well when latency is a concern, so no guitar recording is possible with this. I kind of guessed it wouldn’t work but gave it a try anyway and just as I thought there is maybe a 500ms delay after hitting a string and sound coming through the headphones. Not a big deal as I wasn’t expecting this to work.</p>
<p>Apart from the music usage with the COVID era I’m in virtual meetings and use it to communicate. The audio quality and the mic quality are great, no complaints there. The battery life is also good for home use, I can get 2 days of usage without charging if I leave it in the black case that puts it to ultra power saving mode.</p>
<p>Would I recommend it? I guess it depends on your situation. If you are in the Apple ecosystem the AirPod Max fits in perfectly, has great sound quality and looks sleek (like any Apple product). If you are not in the ecosystem and are audio savvy you could probably get better bang for your buck elsewhere.</p>
