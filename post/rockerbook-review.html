        <div class="content">
        <p>The RocketBook reusable notebook is just what it sounds like - a reusable notebook that you can archive and erase and reuse. The writing experience is somewhere between the Apple pencil + iPad and a plain notebook. You have to use the Pilot Frixion erasable pens which are pleasant to use. The paper on the notebook is coated and feels like it lacks friction. The metal binder makes it difficult to fold it and write on a table because the height difference makes it unstable on the flat surface but it’s not too bad.</p>
<p>The iOS app is good. It’s very easy to snap the pages and archive them as a PDF. This process has to be seamless because you’ll be snapping 20 pages or so when the notebook is full. There are features like some rudimentary OCR to extract titles and categorize pages but I haven’t used any of them. Erasing the pages of the notebook is a hassle. There is a microfiber cloth that comes with it which you have to dampen and scrub the pages clean. That cloth gets dirty with ink and you have to clean it a couple of times and give it a good squeeze and continue cleaning. Maybe the microwave erase version is better, but cleaning is tedious.</p>
<p>I mainly use this for quick note taking during the day, or note taking when reading a book. I also got a small notepad version that’s more portable.</p>
