<p>A tactical feature that was missing after the enemy spawns was an indication of
the tile of the spawn and the time.  Enemies suddenly appearing on the map and
random places doesn’t benefit the strategical and tactical aspect of the game
as the player has no chance to plan and prepare for the new wave of enemies.</p>
<p>I implemented this ETA and location indication on the map. If the player can
get a unit on the tile for the new spawn, it will void.  This is a nice way for
the player to prevent new enemies and gives to opportunity for a trade-off.
Should I defend a building or prevent a new spawn?</p>
<p><img src="/img/ittb4.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The turn mechanics for enemies started out as alternating between movement and
attack. This made the game a bit static, but it was the basis for the push
strategy to save buildings. If an enemy was next to a target at the end of the
movement phase, the next turn would mean a damage to a building, so it was wise
to push the enemy away from the building.</p>
<p>But during the movement turns towards the targets, the attack phase made the
game progression slow. Turns were wasted doing nothing as there wasn’t anything
to attack. I changed this around to the following structure: A turn for an
enemy is either attack or move. If the enemy reaches it’s target after a
movement turn, then it is committed to attacking that target even it’s pushed
away and will not move for that turn. Currently this means doing nothing as the
target is not in range, but I have a 2 ideas on how to stop this attack turn
being wasted. Either store the direction the attack would have been and do an
attack in that direction. If there is anything (un)lucky enough to be on that
tile, it will receive the damage (maybe including friendlies?) Or select a
target in range and just attack that target. I will have to discuss these
options and get some feedback on them.</p>
<p>The game is suffering from being to easy. Go up to the enemies and hit them on
the head. Or even don’t go up to them and attack them from range.  Well
attacking from a distance is nice and realistic but infinite ammo for range
attacks is not. That’s why I implemented a feature to limit the number of
ranged attacks per unit per level. This makes the level progressively harder as
you have to start walking around to hit the enemies after a while.</p>
<p>Also the chunk level generator wasn’t paying attention to the number of
buildings placed on the level. Having 9 buildings on a level makes it easier to
survive (think of buildings as player units). I added a pretty simple function
that tries to adjust the number of buildings on the level based on the current
level the player is at.</p>
