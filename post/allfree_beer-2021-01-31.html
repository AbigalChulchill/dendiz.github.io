        <p>Lately I have been watching my calorie intake to lose some weight and improve my health in general. 
When you are constrainted in this way and you can't cut the bad stuff cold-turkey you start looking
for healthier/low calorie substitutes. I had actually substituted coke zero for regular soda years ago
but there are downsides to sweeteners too so this year I decided to ditch the sweetened drinks too. La Croix
was a great option so I stuck with it for sometime. Even though it has a variety of different flavors to 
choose from it doesn't provide a deep/bold flavor. It's more like someone is cutting a piece of the fruit 
in the kitchen and you can smell it in your drink. This made me look for other alternatives for fizzy drinks
with more body to them and I came across this product &quot;All free&quot; on Amazon.</p>

<p>This is a zero calorie, zero sweetener, low sodium drink. It's not your average non-alcoholic beer with 60 calories.
The reviews were mixed but it had a decent rating of ~4 stars, so I ordered a 6 pack.</p>
<p>Visually I think it looks exactly like beer (even though I usually drink it straight from the can)</p>

<p>The taste resembles lager beer quite a bit. The initial effect on the palate and the fizziness is definitely on par
with regular beer but the after taste is where you can that it's a substitute. I'm not really a beer snob but the 
best way I can describe it is that it lacks the body and affect that a true beer would leave on the palate. 
But for zero calories, I don't really care. I think it's a great drink and I'll keep buying it.</p>
