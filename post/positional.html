        <p>Here is my new addition to the online chess tools I’m currently working on:
Positional – a web based chess position analysis tool. Here is a short screen cast showing what it does:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/HTtWQqM533E">https://youtu.be/HTtWQqM533E</a></p>
<p>It’s meant to give an analysis of the position but you could also use it as to play agains the computer. It uses the Carballo java chess engine behind the scenes. The api that it uses to evaluate also supports stockfish by launching it as an external process and using UCI to speak with it but I find that using an embedded java engine is prettier although it cannot reach stockfishes strength it is still a pretty strong engine. I plan also to add my own engine once it’s finished.</p>
<p>I’m not planning to make this available to the public because chess engines obviously require a lot of server resources and I don’t have them.</p>
