        <div id="date"><em> 2021-02-17</em></div>
        <div class="content">
        <p>After injuring my knee because I was running with the New Balance 990v4 shoes that were worn out, I decided to get a new pair. After hours and hours of research on Amazon reading countless reviews and reading running sites and best running shoe articles, I was left with 2 options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Asics Gel Kayano 27</li>
<li>Ghost Brooks 13</li>
</ul>
<p>Both had stellar reviews and it basically came down to the price and I went with the Ghost 13.</p>
<p>The first thing I thought when I put these on for the first time was &quot;Wow, that is soft&quot;. The cushioning is sublime, just what I was looking for with my injured knee. But the cushioning came with a trade-off: stability. It felt like my foot was &quot;wobbling&quot; and I could feel the slightest incline (left/right) on the sidewalk. I got used to this feeling after a couple of miles in the shoes and they feel pretty comfortable. The overall fit is also pretty snug and my foot doesn't move around in the shoe. After about 75 miles there is minimal ware and tear on the sole even though I do mixed road and trail jogging.</p>
