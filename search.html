I'm a software engineer by trade and have had the chance to work for amazing companies such as [this](https://www.apple.com), [this](https://www.trendyol.com) and [this](https://www.n11.com) and many others. \n\nI like to build things like computer games and AI agents. \n\nSay [hi](mailto:deniz.dizman@gmail.com)\n\n[Linked profile](https://tr.linkedin.com/in/deniz-dizman-a4130450)", "file": "about.ipynb"}, {"title": "thoughts on christopher alexanders oopsla speech", "body": "\nAlexanders thoughts on patterns and how they come to form a living structure can be adapted to software to some extent. CA, not being an expert in the field even mentions mappings of what he calls \"centers\" to software objects. Objects in software can be grouped in a few equivalence classes (interfaces, abstract classes, etc) that correspond to Alexander's core entities and are the building blocks of patterns. Using patterns as a means of information transfer and communication guide lines is already being used extensively. CA asks about the morality and the profoundness of his pattern language and how that is used is software, if it ever is. He mentions that the objective of a living structure is to increase the quality of life of those who experience it. This can be adapted to software, but from a different point of view. Software runs on a system which means it is governed by the virtual machine it runs on and the operating system at the least. So it can only interact with the system in a very constrained way, so there is not too much room for morality here. On the other side the interaction with the humans is the place that can be improved and the software may increase the quality of the experience it offers.\nI think that buildings can be alive or dead like CA mentions, but buildings are not living things. They are static. They can't adapt to the changing environment or the circumstances. But software does have this opportunity. Software should be a living entity. Let me clarify this with a concrete example. The way many people start applications on they computers is usually by selecting the item through a variety of menus. In the DOS era such a visual aid providing an over sight of all the available applications was a contribution to the users perceived quality of life. This sort of application launching is still common today, but programs such as QuickSilver for mac take this one step further by allowing the user to conveniently type just a few letters of the program they wish to run, or an action they wish to perform (e.g copy a file) and adaptively suggest actions to the user by analyzing their usage patterns. This is what I understand from a living entity. The ability to adapt. So yes software can have profoundness and morality, but this can't be achieved by using more design patterns, nor does using any design patterns bring this quality. This can be achieved by making the software understand the users patterns and making it more humane.\nOn the subject of generativity: using a patterns language can't guarantee wholeness and coherence due to the fact that it is localized. So long as one doesn't maintain an outlook at the whole system there is no way of achieving coherence. Hence it is no surprise that their attempt to create a living campus failed in general but delivered locally successful results. The same would be true for any system including software or hardware systems.\nAnother subject of patterns in software in the issue of graphical user interface design and the patterns associated with it.This seems more in tact with the pattern theory of CA. I think in the last decade major improvements have been made to the way we act with computers. Current user interfaces are profound and coherent. Do they increase the quality of our lives? \nprobably yes. Do they make the world a better place? I don't know. These are subjective matters, and I personally am not the type that really cares for \"design\" because I get bored easily. I sold my mac book pro for an ibm thinkpad, what do I understand from design. That's why I shouldn't be taken too seriously on these matters.\n", "file": "caoopsla.ipynb"}, {"title": "hibernate batch statements", "body": "\nHere is a working way to do bulk inserts for hibernate:\n\nFirst make sure that your entity id generation is not AUTO.

If you stop the starvation their chances of perishing will start to decrement once again.\n\nThe ships have crews and now need a life support component.

Moving to random tiles with in the range\nwas annoying anyway so I implemented a target selection algorithm. The basics are the same \nfor the algorithm I had used in the prototype. Pick the closest building based on euclidean\ndistance and go towards that. This type of target selection may sometimes lead to what would\nseem as non optimal. Such as the case\n\n```\n. . . . .\n1 x . @ .\n. x . . .\n. x . . .\n. x . . .\n. . . . .\n. . . 2 .\n```\n\n@ = player\n\n1 = target\n\n2 = target\n\nx = blocker\n\nHere the closest target is 1 based on euclidean distance, when in fact the path to that target\nis way longer than the path to target 2.\n\nBut \u201coptimal\u201d is not what I\u2019m searching for. It\u2019s OK to make the game unpredictable at times,\nso it doesn\u2019t get boring. After the target selection, I added the ability to show a target indication\nfor enemies. This is actually a \u2018threat\u2019 indication as the attack will happen next turn. The enemies\nstay committed to the direction they are attacking if they lock on to a target and will attack\nin that direction if they are pushed/pulled or dislodged some other way. I also added the force move\nand it\u2019s damage effects on the units. I realized that if a weapon can do more than 1 tile force move\nthe code has to be in the movement class, as the damage effects need to be applied after the animation\nto that tile is complete. This lead to the need for separating the movement animation code from the \nmovement class into a separate component. I also needed to add a \u201cFly\u201d method that doesn\u2019t check if\nthe path to a target node contains blockers, as I want the unit to crash into the blockers. While at\nit I also changed the way the movement animations were done. Previously I was LERP\u2019ing the movement \nbetween the tiles, which lead to a movement that gradually sped up when it was getting near to it\u2019s \ntarget. Now I just use a simple method to calculate the amount to move and animate the movement in a\nlinear fashion, which made the animations look better. The idea is quite simple, I don\u2019t know why I\ndidn\u2019t do it in the first place:\n\n```\ndistance = Speed * Time.deltaTime //distance to travel this frame\ndir = target.position - my.position\nif (dir.magnitude > distance) {\n  translate(dir.normalized * distance)\n} else {\n  my.position = target.position\n}\n```\n\nI also added an in game console, which I use for messages as the unity Debug.Log sucks.\n", "file": "ittb_devlog-2018-05-09.ipynb"}, {"title": "ittb devlog 2018-04-22", "body": "## summary\n\n- AI, \n- support units \n- weapons\n- targeting arcs\n\nI thought about different AI enemy types today. Currently the damage, and the\nhealth/armor for the AI was being set within an interval appropriate with the\ncurrent level, but this doesn\u2019t really give the sense that you are fighting\nagainst different enemies. The AI also tries to compensate for the static\nnature by introducing some non-determinism into target selection but still not\nenough. What I need is to have different types of units. E.g a unit that stuns\nthe enemy, like the half snake monsters from XCOM2. Or support units that boost\nthe health of the all the enemies in the level unless it\u2019s destroyed. These\ntypes of units will need their own AI implementations. E.g a support unit won\u2019t\ngo around chasing enemies, it will try to stay as far away from the player as\nit can and evade the player. So to facilitate this, I moved the AI into the\nenemy base class and a portion of it (target selection/movement) to the current\ntype of enemy. (called type A, because I haven\u2019t yet thought about names or a\nstory line etc.). This turned to be a bit tedious with subtle variable\nshadowing bugs creeping in an took a good portion of my day. \n\nThis also lead the way for letting the enemies use the same types of weapons\nthe player was using, for the time being which means that the enemies will soon\nget ranged weapons. This actually has an implication on the user interface, the\nplayer should be able to see which enemy has a ranged weapon and the area that\nit covers. Maybe if this were a PC game a mouse-over the enemy would reveal\nit\u2019s range and coverage but this doesn\u2019t work when you are targeting handheld\ndevices.  I also don\u2019t want to complicate the selection states further by\nrevealing this information when a player is not selected and an enemy is\nselected etc. So the idea I came up with is to display the ranged attack arc of\nthe enemy when the player selects his own unit and that unit can actually move,\nas it only matters when moving. This refactoring lead me to the decision to\nalso move the targeting code from the player and enemy classes into the weapon\nclasses themselves, using the wielder information for target selection (you\ndon\u2019t want to shoot at friendlies). Coming from a server-side programming\nbackground I am used to using lists, arrays etc to use composition in objects,\nbut with the scene tree there, it actually makes more sense to use a node in\nthe scene tree to hold stuff like weapons, as you get the holder of that item\nfrom the scene tree way more easier.  Otherwise you have to pass around the\nreference of the parent etc. This model of programming should also find it\u2019s\nway into other domains. You should be able to freely traverse the object graph. \n\nI was also thinking that all player units would carry a ranged weapon but this\ndoesn\u2019t seem optimal to me now. Some units should only have a melee attack, and\nloot a ranged weapon after progressing in the game? One thing is for sure\nthough you can\u2019t have 2 ranged weapons, as that would require the player to\nselect which one to fire. I want to take a convention over configuration type\nof approach for a mobile game. The convention here being that if you are in\nmelee range you can only do a melee attack. This is also kind of more\nrealistic. If you were in a close brawl with someone would you leave that and\ntry to shoot at something far away?  \n\nI was able to squeeze a couple of hours more out of the day (mostly because my\nSO is away on an MBA class reunion in Nashville) to implement the range arc\ndisplay for enemies that are equipped with a ranged weapon.

One optimization I did\nwas instead of executing the call every frame I added a check to execute it one\nevery 0.5 seconds which is good enough for my purposes.\n\nI was thinking about a type of enemy unit that would manipulate the terrain,\ne.g expand the water tiles or make the volcano\u2019s erupt and make lava flow\naround the map having the same effect as water. When I set out to implement\nthis I realized that the backing array that I used when creating the map\ninitially was kind of limiting. If I wanted to add a new lava tile, I would\nhave to come up with a constant that represented that tile, and then add manage\npath finding code, etc to account for this new tile type. Besides this I was\nmaintaining 2 data structures: the scene tree and matrix containing redundant\ndata. Since I can\u2019t dump the scene tree, I had to dump the matrix. The first\niteration constructs a new matrix when needed from the scene tree on the fly,\nthe use of a 2D matrix makes path finding code a lot more simple. For the\nsecond iteration of refactoring I\u2019m thinking about getting rid of the constant\nthat I had been using to compare tile types, but I\u2019m not sure this can be done.\nI was thinking about comparing class types to get to tile types, but some tiles\nshare a class type, and GD script class type comparison isn\u2019t that good. For\ninstance I could not find a way to compare a class to it self. Say I have a\nfunction that returns all the enemy units on the map and in the support unit I\nwant to skip over the enemy types \u201csupport unit\u201d.

After checking the git commit logs I see 480 new commits,\ntouching 26410 lines for the API and Engine, which is quite a bit. There is\nbasically too much stuff that I have done to cover in detail so I\u2019ll just have\nto go over the most import changes for this month.\n\nFirst off I want to start with the automation tasks. I was running the BFX, IEX\nsync tasks, scanner tasks via crontab on the test machine. This was OK for some\ntime, but it wasn\u2019t getting notifications about failed jobs or any information\nabout the task duration. So I moved all these periodic engine tasks to Jenkins.\nAnother added bonus is it\u2019s way easier to manage the task pipeline (which task\nshould run after which task, which can run in parallel) from Jenkins rather\nthan a bunch of ad-hoc shell scripts. I also changed the development cycle from\ncommitting code to master to committing first into a development branch, and\nthen asking Jenkins via Hubbot through slack to test and merge and push the\nchanges. This keeps the master branch at a stable state all the time. G.\nrequested that any pushes to the master branch of the web client repository be\ndeployed immediately so I had to do some GitLab trickery to get that working,\nas GitLab doesn\u2019t allow that for unpaid accounts. But it can be done via web\nhooks.\n\nThe current flow of crons are looking like this\n\n*lost image*\n\nUsing spring boot is a MUST if you are developing with Java \u2013 the advantages it\nprovides are countless, but it does come with it\u2019s own quirks. I had been\ngetting \u201ctransaction manage not found \u2013 cannot remove entity\u201d errors on some of\nthe data sync services. The solutions on the internet were all about adding a\ntransactional annotation to the service method and people had accepted those\nanswers. But I guess something changed along the way in spring development as\nthey did not work for me. The solution is was to add the annotation to the\nrepository interface. Sometimes something so simple can eat up a lot of\nprecious development time, but it\u2019s satisfying in the end when you solve it. As\nI was fiddling around with this I also decided to save the response JSON from\nthe providers instead of parsing them into domain entities and saving those.\nNow instead of having 1 M daily data points, I have 8 K key value items and I\nprocess them in memory. I was caching the domain objects anyways so this spares\nsome extra load on the database.\n\nDuring development I wanted to get the engine results as fast as possible so I\nwas parallelizing all the operations in the engine. I noticed along the way\nthat \u201cparallelStream\u201d is not the answer to all of the question. I ran into\ncases where parallelizing would really screw up the cache, and serial\nprocessing with a good cache usage is way better (in terms of efficiency) than\njust using all the cores. I can get more bang for a core than I could when the\nprocessing was done in parallel. This decision was also in part due to the fact\nthat I want to run the engine on the same machine as the API (yes, I am\nbasically poor) and I can\u2019t have the engine hogging all the CPU and exhausting\nRAM. I can\u2019t also have the entire data set in memory (or most of it) and this\ntends to happen when threads are running at the same time. So with the serial\nprocessing using the cache in an optimal way, the scanning process takes 2.5 K\nseconds on a single core. Running in parallel took 600 seconds on 8 cores.\n\nA prerequisite to serialize the scanners was to improve their performance. I\ninstalled the excellent YourKit profiler trail version (which by the way is\nvery expensive \u2013 otherwise I would buy it) and tracked down the bottle necks to\nunnecessary object wrapping (using my own SuperList class with convenience\nmethods for accessing elements, like getLast(N), getTail(..), etc.) and the\nparsing of string to dates and vice versa. After hunting these down and\nrefactoring the code to get rid of extra layers and work, there was a 3x\nincrease in speed which brings the processing time to acceptable limits.\n\nAn integral part of the system is the performance evaluator for scans based on\npast performance. I had coded this in a hurry and it was a bit disgusting, so I\nrefactored this into it\u2019s own service. The functionality is the same but it\u2019s\nsimplified and runs a bit faster.\n\nI hate the verbosity of Java so I thought I\u2019d look into what was going on in\nthe Java world, which I hadn\u2019t done since the release of Java 8 and the\nstreaming API. I found out that Java 10 was released March 2018 and finally had\nsupport for the \u201cvar\u201d keyword, which meant less verbosity in assignments. I\nknow it\u2019s kind of trivial but I wanted to give it a go, since spring boot it\nsupposed to support Java 10. So I went ahead and updated the development and\ntest environments to Java 10 and compiled the code. A couple of warnings of\nunsafe access in spring but otherwise everything seemed OK. That is until I\ntried running the API. Then a lot of exceptions about Redis not being happy\nwith something (which I don\u2019t remembers, and could not find an easy solution\nfor), so I reverted back to 8, which is way more stable. I have long lines of\ncode, but at least everything works correctly\n\n![](/img/1-m79Makp8mOHomhro.png)\n\nA great Idea that I had for the engine was parameter optimizations. RSI\noversold is 80, but why? why not 60?\n\nI guess the guy who invented it had success with 80 and kept it as a default\nand now everybody uses that. But wouldn\u2019t it be great if I could figure out the\noptimal number by scanning the past RSI turning points? That\u2019s what parameter\noptimization/recommendation is about. There are a LOT of combinations to\ncalculate so this feature has to be selective on the symbols and the parameter\nvalues that it tries. I still have to bake this idea, but I did put down a PoC\nservice that does this.\n\nI also started with the mobile client development using PhoneGap and Framework\n7 with Vue.js. Vue.js is pretty amazing \u2013 at last someone has come up with a\ngood framework for JavaScript development. I used to be a Mithril person but\nthe lack of templating and using that m() function was a bit annoying. Also the\ncomponent system in Mithril is complicated and not easy as Vue.js. Framework7\nlooks OK\u2019ish but there are some quirks with it too. I ran into a problem with\nthe router, that would break the back button randomly. It\u2019s surprisingly\ndifficult to find answers to question \u2013 I guess they don\u2019t have a large\ncommunity so I\u2019ll probably drop F7 in favor Vuetify.\n\nThat was a long post, but I guess this is how it\u2019s gonna be if I do it monthly.\nI still want to do a write up about the team dynamics, and the frustration that\nI\u2019m having with that.\n", "file": "techscan_devlog_2018-10-08.ipynb"}, {"title": "hex grid border highlighting", "body": "\nPreviously I've been doing this by actually highlighting all the possible cells, but it's looks a lot better if you just highlight the borders.

After we have the cells that we can navigate to we need to filter out the border cells. If you look carefully the edges that need highlighting from all the cells in range are the ones that do not have a navigable neighbor. In the image the cell (4,-6,2) and (5,-6,1) are both in range, but they share a border with a navigable cell, so that edge should not be highlighted.

By training the model on a set on \ninput data the process creates a chain with each link containing a set of the next probable elements. By starting at a random link in the chain \nand following until you reach an ending node it's possible to get similar names to the original set. \n\nHere is an example of how this works:\nSay you have the training input \n\n`[sally sells seashells]`\n\nwe will partition the input into 2 letter groups (the order of the chain is 2) and record the next letters that follow each partition. $ means end of word. \n\n```\n(sa) -> l\n(al) -> l\n(ly) -> $\n\n(se) -> l\n(el) -> l\n(ll) -> s\n(ls) -> $\n\n(se) -> a\n(ea) -> s\n(as) -> h\n(sh) -> e\n(he) -> l\n(el) -> l\n(ll) -> s\n(ls) -> $\n```\n\nnow we combine the same keys \n\n```\n(sa) -> (l)\n(al) -> (l)\n(ll) -> (y)\n(ly) -> ($)\n(se) -> (l,a)\n(el) -> (l,l)\n(ll) -> (s,s)\n(ls) -> ($,$)\n(ea) -> (s)\n(as) -> (h)\n(sh) -> (e)\n(he) -> l\n```\n\nwe have built our chain. To generate a new name we pick a random starting point and follow the chain by appending one of the characters in the \nvalues until we reach an end or have a long enough string. Let's say we picked ea to start. Here is a sample string that we could end up with\n\n```\n(ea) + s -> eas\ne(as) + h -> eash\nea(sh) + e -> eashe\neas(he) + l -> eashel\n...\n```\n\nwe would end up with `eashells`.

But when you are dealing with hex grids \nlife gets a bit more complicated. Representing a backing array for a hex grid can be done in the following way\n\n```\n[\n  [null,null,null,{},{},{},{}],\n  [null,null,{},{},{},{},{}],\n  [null,{},{},{},{},{},{}],\n  [{},{},{},{},{},{},{}],\n  [{},{},{},{},{},{},null],\n  [{},{},{},{},{},null,null],\n  [{},{},{},{},null,null,null]]\n```\n\nthis would be the representation array for the following grid\n\n\nthe row 3 in the array is the row in the center of the grid. If you go up one row the row becomes an element shorter (represented by a null element). \nYou could also skip adding the null element and use different length elements for each row, but that brings it own advantages and disadvantages. \nThe radius of the grid is defined as the length on the longest row for the hex shaped grid. Now for a given radius of N how could we generate \nthe backing array for that grid?\n\nThe property to notice here is that the number of nulls increases from the middle out by one.

No need to scan the queue every time, just keep track\nof the element in the queue in a set. I also realized during test playing that\nnewly spawned water tiles could lead to islands in the map. So a check for\nconnectivity was needed before adding that new water tile to the queue. This\nlead me to fix a performance issue in the connectivity checking code. A split\nthe tile-tile checking code from the slower building \u2013 tile checking code. I\u2019m\nstill not sure if I should let water tiles spawn on building tiles. This is\nfrustrating for the player because most of the time there is nothing you can do\nto stop it. It\u2019s simply not possible to kill the remaining enemies in the\nnumber of turn given to save the building and this does reduce the global\nbuilding preservation count. On the other hand it does make the game a bit more\ndifficult and exciting.\n\nA couple of days ago I had noticed that some enemies froze occasionally.\nInvestigation into this led me to discover that it was possible for the enemies\nto select a building/mountain tile as the location for an attack on the player\nin some configurations. I implemented a fix for this and also implemented a fix\nfor selecting unreachable tiles. I\u2019m wondering if I should just let the enemies\ndo a random walk if they don\u2019t get a movement tile or just let them sit frozen\nfor a couple of turns?\n\nDuring one test game I was blessed (!) with a mech that had 5 speed. This made\nit super easy to go around killing all the enemies very fast before a wave came\nin to their rescue. After progressing about 5 levels the game crashed with a\nNPE because the level generator could not place the number of required units on\nthe deployment zone for the enemies. There just wasn\u2019t enough free tiles!. What\nthis means is this\n\n* The weapon/item generation system is flawed. Why would I get a +5 speed mech\n  in the first level?\n* Not just more enemies each level, we also need stronger enemies. \n* There has to be a trade-off between speed, weapon strength, range. \n\nThese were issues I was previously aware of, and had in my to do list. The\nsolution is a points system which measures the strength of the units and\nadjusts the level difficulty based on this.\n\nAlso I\u2019m thinking of introducing a weight and maybe a heat system to implement\nthe trade off between items. To install an AC with +2 damage means your speed\nis reduced by 1. So if you have a mech that\u2019s only speed 1 you can\u2019t install\nthat weapon. With the current setup of only 1 item per mech this also means\nthat if can\u2019t have armor + speed. So if your mechs initial speed is 1 you\ncannot have AC2 + armor which may have a negative effect on game play. \n\nI also saw an issue where the supports unit would surround a normal enemy unit\nand would not budge effectively freezing that unit in place. I set an upper\nlimit of 1 for support units on the map.  Now that the unit lab development is\ncomplete and we can equip the units with items and weapons things are looking a\nlot better. We also implemented a budgeting system for generating the weapon\nstats based on level. Each level you get a budget of say 5 units and this\nbudget is distributed randomly to the stats of the loot being generated. This\ntype of generation also brought a balance to the game.

These type of problems are very well suited for step by step iterative solutions where each step you improve upon the existing solution. \nThe problem is the simple matter of find the first unique character in a string. \nI'm skipping the obvious solution of starting at the beginning of the string and scanning through the string comparing the current charater with every other. This type of solution will lead to an N^2 solution which is usually unacceptable. Think that you are searching a DNA sequence of 10 million nucleotides. No way exponential solutions are going to work. \nSo the first solution is this:\n\n1. scan the list from left, and keep track of the characters and the number of times we have seen a character. \n2. scan the list from left and lookup the number of times the current character was seen. If it's 1 then we've found the first non-repeating character.\n\n```\nCharacter findFirstUniqWorst(String s) {\n        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();\n        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {\n            if (!map.containsKey(c)) {\n                map.put(c, 0);\n            }\n            int e = map.get(c);\n            map.put(c, e + 1);\n        }\n\n        for (char c: s.toCharArray()) {\n            if (map.get(c) == 1) {\n\n                return c;\n            }\n        }\n\n        throw new RuntimeException();\n    }\n\n```\n\nan improvement on this would be to eliminate the 2nd scan. If we stored the position of the 1st occurance of a character with the count we could return that. Something like: \n\n1. scan the list from the left and build the count map. Store the position of the first occurance too like 'a'->(count, position) \n2. scan the map and return the result with count equal to 1 having to lowest position.\n\n```\nstatic class Pair {\n        public int count;\n        public int position;\n\n        public Pair(int count, int position) {\n            this.count = count;\n            this.position = position;\n        }\n    }\n    Character findFirstUniqMed(String s) {\n        HashMap<Character, Pair> map = new HashMap<>();\n        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();\n        for (int i=0;i<chars.length;i++) {\n            char c = chars[i];\n            if (!map.containsKey(c)) {\n                map.put(c, new Pair(1, i));\n            } else {\n                Pair e = map.get(c);\n                e.count += 1;\n                map.put(c, e);\n            }\n        }\n        int index = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n        Character returnChar = null;\n        for (Character c : map.keySet()) {\n            if (map.get(c).count == 1) {\n                if (map.get(c).position < index) {\n                    returnChar = c;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return returnChar;\n    }\n```\n\nthis is a good option if the alphabet is small like in the DNA example. But if the alphabet is large, we still would do a large scan. So enter the third option: \ninstead of keeping the position of the character, keep a pointer to a linked list node. This linkedlist will hold the the unique characters we've seen so far and the head of the link list will be the first. \n\n1. scan the list from the left. \n     1. if the character is not in the map, insert a node to the tail of the list and add the (char->node) mapping \n     2. if the characater is in the map, and pointer to a node exists remove the node from the link delete, set (char->null) as the mapping \n     3. if the character is in the map and the pointer doesn't exists do nothing and continue with the next. \n\t \nthis method will scan the input string once but return the first found character o(1).\n\n```\nstatic class DoubleLinkedList {\n        public Character value;\n        public DoubleLinkedList prev;\n        public DoubleLinkedList next;\n    }\n    Character findFirstUniqBest(String s) {\n        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();\n        DoubleLinkedList list = new DoubleLinkedList();\n        HashMap<Character, DoubleLinkedList> map = new HashMap<>();\n        DoubleLinkedList head, tail;\n        head = list;\n        tail = list;\n        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {\n            char cur = chars[i];\n            if (!map.containsKey(cur)) {\n                DoubleLinkedList node = new DoubleLinkedList();\n                node.value = cur;\n                node.prev = tail;\n                node.next = null;\n                tail.next = node;\n                map.put(cur, node);\n                tail = node;\n            } else {\n                if (map.get(cur) != null) {\n                    if (map.get(cur).prev == null) {\n                        head = map.get(cur).next;\n                    } else {\n                        map.get(cur).prev.next = map.get(cur).next;\n                    }\n                    if (map.get(cur).next == null) {\n                        map.get(cur).prev.next=null;\n                        tail = map.get(cur).prev;\n                    } else {\n                        map.get(cur).next.prev = map.get(cur).prev;\n                    }\n                    map.put(cur, null);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        if (head == null) throw new RuntimeException();\n        return head.value == null ? head.next.value : head.value;\n    }\n```\n", "file": "3-different-approaches.ipynb"}, {"title": "k closest star selection", "body": "\nIn my post about generation galaxy warp lanes [GalaxyWarpLaneGeneration][1] I talked about the a naive method that would select the N closest stars to a given star. \nEven though the name states the method as naive it isn't such a naive tasks when you consider large amounts of stars.

So the total will be o(N * logK)\nI am usually connecting 2 or 3 stars which result in 1000 * log2 which is around 300 operations vs. 1000 * log(1000) which is also 300 operations.\nIt doesn't make a difference for the basic case.

Enemies suddenly appearing on the map and\nrandom places doesn\u2019t benefit the strategical and tactical aspect of the game\nas the player has no chance to plan and prepare for the new wave of enemies. \n\nI implemented this ETA and location indication on the map. If the player can\nget a unit on the tile for the new spawn, it will void.  This is a nice way for\nthe player to prevent new enemies and gives to opportunity for a trade-off.\nShould I defend a building or prevent a new spawn?\n\n![](/img/ittb4.png)\n\nThe turn mechanics for enemies started out as alternating between movement and\nattack. This made the game a bit static, but it was the basis for the push\nstrategy to save buildings. If an enemy was next to a target at the end of the\nmovement phase, the next turn would mean a damage to a building, so it was wise\nto push the enemy away from the building.\n\nBut during the movement turns towards the targets, the attack phase made the\ngame progression slow. Turns were wasted doing nothing as there wasn\u2019t anything\nto attack. I changed this around to the following structure: A turn for an\nenemy is either attack or move. If the enemy reaches it\u2019s target after a\nmovement turn, then it is committed to attacking that target even it\u2019s pushed\naway and will not move for that turn. Currently this means doing nothing as the\ntarget is not in range, but I have a 2 ideas on how to stop this attack turn\nbeing wasted. Either store the direction the attack would have been and do an\nattack in that direction. If there is anything (un)lucky enough to be on that\ntile, it will receive the damage (maybe including friendlies?) Or select a\ntarget in range and just attack that target. I will have to discuss these\noptions and get some feedback on them.\n\nThe game is suffering from being to easy. Go up to the enemies and hit them on\nthe head. Or even don\u2019t go up to them and attack them from range.  Well\nattacking from a distance is nice and realistic but infinite ammo for range\nattacks is not. That\u2019s why I implemented a feature to limit the number of\nranged attacks per unit per level. This makes the level progressively harder as\nyou have to start walking around to hit the enemies after a while.  \n\nAlso the chunk level generator wasn\u2019t paying attention to the number of\nbuildings placed on the level. Having 9 buildings on a level makes it easier to\nsurvive (think of buildings as player units). I added a pretty simple function\nthat tries to adjust the number of buildings on the level based on the current\nlevel the player is at.\n", "file": "ittb_devlog_2018-04-21.ipynb"}, {"title": "ittb devlog 2018-05-01", "body": "\n## Summary\n\n- difficulty mechanics\n- attack mechanics\n\nThe difficulty of the level was being determined by the number of enemies, but\nthe enemy stats were being generated randomly. This meant that some games level\n2 could be much more harder than other games. To balance this I came up with a\nbudgeting system. Each level has a budget that is a function of the level\nnumber. The more advanced the level, the higher the budget. At the start of\neach level, this budget is consumed according to the stats of the randomly\ngenerated enemy. So if say the level 2 budget is 10, you could have 3 monsters\nwith 3 stats, or 2 with 5 each. This keeps the game dynamic while keeping the\nlevels balanced. For the in-level enemy spawns, the budget is increased each\nturn according to the current level. Further on the game the in-level budget\nincrease is much high therefore more/stronger enemies spawn. \n\nI also changed the end of level loots to a random number between one and two.\nSometimes you\u2019ll be lucky and get two, but this should not affect the game\nprogression that much. \n\nI also increased enemy melee damage with level and building armor too. This\nprovides a way to decide on which buildings to protect from which enemy. Also\nit\u2019s now a good idea to check an enemies damage before deciding to go in for a\nmelee or ranged attack. \n\nI tried playing around with the committed attack directions. This means that\nonce the enemy is committed to an attack, they will keep the relative direction\nof the attack, and do the attack on that square even if it means damaging a\nfriendly. I though this would lead to more tactical game play, by pushing\nenemies into tiles that will be attacked for sure the next turn, but that\ndoesn\u2019t happen as much I as thought it would, so I reverted the code. \n\nA peculiar thing with Godot is that freed objects are not set to null. This\nlead to a subtle bug: If the player dies, and you click on an enemy to see some\ninfo about the guy that killed you the game would crash. This was happening\nbecause the player object had been freed and there was a reference in the info\nlabel to the player object. There was a null check if place, but that didn\u2019t\ncover it. The current solution is the wrap that object with a weak reference,\nbut that means changing every access of the target variable with a weak\nreference. Meh. What I came up with is checking the the target object is in the\nscene tree during the label update.  The label update is done every frame, so\nthis is potentially a performance bottleneck, but since it is only run when the\nenemy is selected it is an acceptable trade-off for a clean approach.\n", "file": "ittb_devlog_2018-05-01.ipynb"}, {"title": "ittb devlog 2018-05-07", "body": "\n## Summary\n\n- map generation\n- movement, path finding\n- loot generation, weapons\n\nported over the path finding code and map validation. I ran into a stupid typo\nbug that was screwing up the lee path expansion matrix code, which took me 2\nhours to debug and fix. And it turned out to be one of those 1 character typos\n(wrote a y instead of x). This stuff can be so frustrating sometimes! I also\nstarted genericising the names for the in-game components as the theme is not\ndecided completely yet. So instead of calling a tile \u201cwater\u201d I just call it a\n\u201ckiller\u201d tile as it could be water or it could be fire. I also did JetBrains\nRider a favor and cleared 99% of the warnings and applied it\u2019s suggestions.\nIt\u2019s annoying to have code fragments underlined and highlighted. In the\nprototype move of the behavior and data and logic code were in the same file,\nbut with unity using the component system it\u2019s easy to separate these so the\nunit selection and unit movement code went into their own components. It\u2019s\nquite nice to have a unit class that\u2019s pretty short and these types attributes\nand behaviors in different components. I have seen a player class in one of the\nopen source rogue-likes that around 5 K lines of code. I could never wrap my\nhead around it or even manage that much code in a single file.  I also\nimplemented the movement arcs, and the unit selection indication. I refactored\nsome methods to return game objects (tile processing code) which I later\nreverted back the base component class to take better advantage of static\ntyping. It\u2019s easy to access the game object on the component to get another one\nanyways, so it makes more sense to return the base component. \n\nIn the prototype the units were kind of teleport-ed to a location when clicked\non them, with a line showing path it came from. Now I have the units animate\ntile by tile to their destination. This is a nice way to reduce the clutter on\nthe map and make the game look more professional. But now I had to come up with\na way to disable the next turn button when a unit is moving. Otherwise if the\nplayer would press the button the enemies would start moving and the game would\nstop being turn based but be more real time, and I\u2019m sure it would cause a lot\nmore bugs and complications. The animation of the units works by calculating\nthe path it will take and queuing these tiles up in the movement behavior. If\nthe queue is full, it means the unit is moving and the button should be\ndisabled. So I added a co-routine in the button behavior that checks this for\nall ally units and adjusts the button state accordingly. The queue is processed\nin the Update loop for each unit, so the checks have to be done in a separate\nthread. I also added some enemy units, and after the players turn the enemy\nunits make their move. In the prototype the enemy units were teleporting too,\nso I could just process their calculations sequentially and be done with it.\nNow I have to do the same checks I did for the \u201cnext turn\u201d button for the\nenemies so that they play one after the other. \n\nI also ported a part of the loot generator for weapons. This part was bugging\nme in the prototype as the implementation done by GO was based on a data\ncentered approach you would use in a functional language and not really OOP.\nWhat I have so far is a function that returns a random prefab from the\navailable weapons, and the code that spawns the player randomizes the weapon\nparameters and adds the weapon instance as a child node to the player. I need\nto get the parameter randomization code into the loot generator, and add the\nitems to a player inventory.

In this post I will go over algorithms that can be \nused when using a graph to represent the grid. Let\u2019s start with the weapon range, as the movement range is a bit more complicated since it has some \ndifferent constrains.\n\nThe range of a weapon is defined as all the cells in all directions from the home cell that are < N units away. Think like the inside area of a circle.\n\n\n![](/img/57de523c6fd8e.jpg)\n\n\nIf the yellow cell is the home cell, then the purple cells are all the cells that are 1 units away, and the orange cells + purple cells are all the cells \nthat are 2 units away.  So given the yellow colored home cell, how can we get the cells that are N units away?\n\n\nThis is a classical graph walk with a range constraint. Instead of visiting all nodes, or quitting when a node is found, we need to quit when we exhaust our range. \nSo we need to keep track of the range, that\u2019s for sure. We also need to consider when we decrease this range, because for all purple cells the range from the \nhome cell is 1, and we cannot decrease the range each time we visit a purple cell. What we need is to keep track of how many purple cells there are and decrease \nthe range after we have consumed them all. We will need track of this by using 2 extra counters: nodesInNext and nodesInCurrent . nodesInNext  will hold the count \nof the neighbors in the next level and the current will hold how much of the current level we have consumed. There are recursive graph traversing algorithms \nand there are ones using stacks and queues. We\u2019ll opt for a non-recursive algorithm here\n\n```\n... get the home cell and add it to the queue\ngoneRange = N //how far is our range?\nnodesInCurrent = 1 /*home cell*/, nodesInNext = 0;\nwhile(queue.Count > 0 && goneRange > 0)\n{\n    nodesInCurrent--;\n    currentCell = queue.Dequeue();\n    List<Cell> neighborList = new List<Cell>();\n    foreach (Cell item in currentCell.neighbors)\n    {\n        if (item != null) neighborList.Add(item);\n    }\n    neighborList.Remove(homeCell);\n    IEnumerable<HexCell> nlist =  neighborList.Except(result);\n    nodesInNext += nlist.Count();\n    foreach (Cell neighbor in nlist)\n    {\n        queue.Enqueue(neighbor);\n        result.Add(neighbor);\n    }\n \n    if (nodesInCurrent == 0)\n    {\n        goneRange--;\n        nodesInCurrent = nodesInNext;\n        nodesInNext = 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nthe result list will contain all the cells that are in range and we can use that. Note that this doesn\u2019t check for friendly fire.\n\nThe movement range calculations are bit more interesting as there is the condition that a rotation move also costs 1 range. Take a look at this diagram\n\n![](/img/57de52979442d.jpg)\n\nStarting at the orange cell facing NE the yellow cell is in range 1. The cell NE of the yellow cell is in range 2 as it is in the same direction. \nThe cells to the NW and E of the orange cell are in range 2 because 1 range point would be used to rotate the ship from NE to NW and NE to E. \nLet\u2019s solve this algorithm with a recursive approach. Here is the outline of what we will try to implement\n\n* if no more range points left, return\n* if the result set doesn\u2019t contain the current cell, add it\n* for the next 3 directions, if there is a neighbor cell in that direction recurse with range \u2013 1 in that direction otherwise decrease range points.\n* for the previous 2 directions, if there is a neighbor cell in that direction recurse with range \u2013 1 in that direction otherwise decrease range points.\n\nSo if we are facing NE like the diagram, and we have 2 range points, we will go to the yellow neighbor. We still have have range point so we\u2019ll go NE. \nNow we don\u2019t have any range points so add this cell to the results. Backtrack to the yellow cell and decrease the range points. \nThe next direction is E, but we don\u2019t have any range points. This will hold for all the remaining directions on the this cell,\nso we backtrack to the orange cell. The next direction is E, and we consumed a range point by turning in this direction so we have 1 point left. \nThere is a cell to the E so go to that cell and add it to the list\u2026 you get the idea.\n\n```\npublic void CellRangeMovement(Cell currentCell, int rangeLeft, List<Cell> result, Direction direction)\n{\n \n    if (rangeLeft < 0) return;\n    if (!result.Contains(currentCell))\n    {\n        result.Add(currentCell);\n    }\n \n    Direction nextDirection = direction;\n    int rangeReg = rangeLeft;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)\n    {\n        Cell currentNeighbor = currentCell.neighbors[nextDirection];\n        if (currentNeighbor != null)\n        {\n            CellRangeMovement(currentNeighbor, rangeReg-1, result, nextDirection);\n        }\n        nextDirection = nextDirection.Next();\n        rangeReg--;\n    }\n \n    rangeReg = rangeLeft;\n    nextDirection = direction;\n    for (int i = 1; i < 3; i++)\n    {\n        Cell currentNeighbor = currentCell.neighbors[nextDirection];\n        if (currentNeighbor != null)\n        {\n            CellRangeMovement(currentNeighbor, rangeReg - 1, result, nextDirection);\n        }\n        nextDirection = nextDirection.Prev();\n        rangeReg--;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOne interesting point here is that, you cannot rotate 6 six times clockwise to get all the directions, as that would mean consuming extra ranges, \ne.g if you are facing NE and want to face NW you would not go E,SE,SW,W,NW. You would just go NE, NW.

I\u2019ve created a multi module\nspring project with the following modules: API, Databus, Engine, corelib. The\nAPI is the gateway for clients to access analysis data and takes care of user\nmanagement.  The databus module is an API for the api module to access the\ndata. The engine is a command line application that does the actual\ncalculations and the corelib is the module that contains common classes shared\nby the modules. After initial testing it turned out that having the Databus as\na separate service comes with severe performance penalties due to JSON data\nconversions etc, so I integrated the databus module into the corelib module.\nYou want to go service oriented until you realize that there are only 2 other\nservices that want to consume it and then you decide to integrate it back.\nKeeping the engine separate made sense though as it runs as a batch processor.\n\n# Current status\n\nAs of today there are 33 unique scanners, and I also run the 2 element\ncombinations of these scanners for a total of 33c2 (528) scanners.  This\nproduces around 6 M scan results for a 20 month worth of stock EOD data. I want\nto increase the combination count but I\u2019m not sure if the server I have in mind\nfor production deployment can handle the amount. That\u2019s on my try this list and\nwill report how it goes.  I have most of the basic user management features\ncompleted in the API, except for the integrations to payment and transactional\nemails.  I\u2019m also adding performance evaluation for the scanners by means of\nrunning a test from the date the signal was generated going forward and\nchecking the price went up/down X ATRs confirming the signal.

I\u2019ve asked a question on\nthe math StackExchange forum about calculating the conditional probability of 2\ntechnical indicator but have yet to receive a satisfying answer. Being able to\ncalculate a reasonably (~%1 error maybe?) accurate approximation for this would\nmean that I do not have the actually run all the combinations to get their\nscores. I\u2019m also using an error rate calculation based on Z-tables to give a\nconfidence interval on the scanner score.  A nice optimization I did was to\nkeep all the stock OHLCV data in cache and use a binary search to query data\nbetween given dates instead of hitting the DB for each time. In the earlier\nversion I was actually keeping the raw OHLCV data in files but reading them\ninto cache takes longer than reading them from a DB plus using a DB also gives\nopportunities for querying in different ways which I need in the future.\n\nYesterday I noticed that one the scanners used 4 conditions to check for a\nsignal ma5 > ma26 , ma26 > ma50, ma50 > ma200, stoch < 20.  This led me to the\nidea that I should actually make each of these conditions a scanner on it\u2019s own\nand brute force my way through all of the combinations to reach the ideal\nscenario for each symbol by calculating the score. Maybe the best results for a\nstock are when ma5 < ma26, ma26 > ma50, \u2026 because there was a short term fall\nin the price for the stoch to reach a low etc.  I also implemented an\noptimization for the score calculator yesterday. Pre-optimization I was looping\neach symbol, fetching the scan results for each symbol and calculating the\nscore for the scanners from those results. This was doing too much DB round\ntrips. I changed it to looping through each scanner combination and storing the\nresults of the scans in a map keyed by it\u2019s symbol.

Indirect firing weapons don\u2019t require\na direct line of sight, these will be weapons like rockets, or attack drones.\nDirect fire weapons are your classical AC and laser type weapons. L.O.S is\nnormally a tricky thing to implement when you are doing it for an arc F.O.V but\nthe weapons in this game are simple, and only have effect on files and ranks.\nSo no diagonals means easier L.O.S sigh implementation.

Instead of\nmaking N parallel requests to Redis per stock symbol and parsing and storing\nthem in the local cache, I do a single multi get to Redis, then parse the JSON\ndata in parallel and store them into the cache. This is way faster (I didn\u2019t\nmeasure the exact amount). Even after this optimization it was still not fast\nenough. I can\u2019t wait more than 10 seconds for the cache warm-up.

Each player has a home planet with 10 production points. Your home world and planets that you have conquered are shown with a green ring around them. Production points are used to make ships that are spawn on that planet and can be sent to other planets to conquer them. To send a ship click the source planet then the target planet. If you click on the planet and select the same planet as the target, you will initiate a planet defense which I explain later. Once you order your ships they will start traveling towards their destination. If they encounter enemy ships on their path they might engage the enemy. You will notice that their movements and directions change when they start dog fighting with enemies. Once they destroy the enemy they will continue on their mission to the target planet. When they reach the planet, if the planet is yours they will add to the production points. If the planet is an enemy planet they will reduce the production points. If its neutral the planet will be yours with all its production points. The aim of the game is to conquer all the planets in the stellar system.\n\n### Planets\nEach player starts with a home planet. The home planet starts with 10 production points and gains 1 point / second. The maximum points it can produce is 10. That means after the points are greater than 10 it will not produce anything. But if you send reinforcements to the galaxy they will still be added to the points, but it won\u2019t grow. There are 12 different types of planets each with different growth rates and max points. An important part of your strategy should be conquering planets that produce fast and a lot of points.\n\n\n### Ships\nThere are 4 types of ships with different speeds, shield, costs, and firepower. When you send ships from a planet to another one the planet will spend half of its points to create these ships. The planet must have at least 80% of its max points to produce a battle ship and at least 60% of its max points to produce a heavy cruiser. The light cruiser and fighter can be produced if there is enough points. The production of ships is influenced by the heavy/light setting.\n\n![](/img/coscon1.png)\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to produce any battle ships or heavy cruisers switch to light mode. If you want these heavy class ships switch to heavy mode. There is on guarantee that the heavy ships will be produced even if there are enough points but the chances are significantly higher in heavy mode that they will.\nAt the beginning of the game, it doesn\u2019t make much sense to produce heavy ships as the opponents will be far away and you will most likely not be engaging in dog fights but will be trying to conquer planets. After you have a couple of planets and are attacking enemy planets heavy ships will be useful as they will destroy enemy ships with power. If your ships attacks an enemy planet it will decrease the planets points by it it\u2019s hull size, but if you send it as a reinforcement to one of your planets it will only increase the planet points by 1. So be careful when sending reinforcements.\nThe ships have the following properties:\nAll ships are indestructible for 2 seconds after they are created.\n\n\n1. Beams/sec \u2013 The firing rate of the ship if it is combat with an enemy.\n2. Attack range \u2013 The maximum distance they ships lasers are effective.\n3. Damage HP \u2013 The amount of damage on the enemy armor in case of a hit.\n4. Seek range \u2013 The maximum distance the ship will sense an enemy ship to engage.\n5. Speed \u2013 The distance the ship travels per time.\n6. Armor \u2013 The protection around the ship. If the armor is destroyed the ship will explode.\n7. Shield chance \u2013 The probability that the enemy laser will be deflected by the shield.\n8. Hull size \u2013 The cost in production points of building this ship, and the damage it will do to enemy planets.\n\n\n| Type        | Beams/s | Range | HP | Seek | Speed | Armor | Shield p | hull |\n|-------------|---------|-------|----|------|-------|-------|----------|------|\n| battle ship |       3 |    12 | 20 |   15 |   1.5 |    40 |      0.8 |    4 |\n| fighter     |       1 |     7 |  5 |   10 |   2.5 |    10 |      0.2 |    1 |\n| heavy cr.   |       2 |    10 | 15 |   15 |   1.7 |    30 |      0.4 |    3 |\n| light cr.   |     1.5 |     7 | 10 |   15 |     2 |    20 |      0.5 |    2 |\n\n\nAs ships travel to their destinations they will encounter enemy ships. The aggression factor will determine the probability of engaging enemy ships. 0% means that your ships will continue towards their destination planet, even under fire. 100% means that they will engage the enemy.\n\n![](/img/coscon2.png)\n\nIf you send ships to their creation planet (by double clicking on a planet) they will sit in orbit waiting for enemy ships to arrive and will engage them to defend the planet.\nEach player may have a maximum of 25 ships enroute at any time. (current number of ships are display under the credits on the bottom left)\n\n### Perks\n\nEvery second the players gain a credit point that they can spend on purchasing perks. Perks are valid for a period of time and then they are gone. You cannot purchase the same perk while it\u2019s active. The players credits are displayed at the bottom left\n\n![](/img/coscon3.png)\n\n#### Warp Perk\nThis will increase the speed of all ships by 100% for 5 seconds and costs 25 credits.\n\n### Range Perk\nThis will increase the attack range of all ships by 5 for 3 seconds and costs 35 credits.", "file": "coscon.ipynb"}, {"title": "scrabble solver script", "body": "\nI've been challenged by burcin at a game of scrabble - the Turkish version. She is quite crafty with words and can easily beat me and all of her friends. \nBut I'm crafty with computers so I wrote a nice groovy script to play for me. I'm quite ok with making the strategical decisions, so the script just \nfinds the best possible word for a given state. To make it play a good game of scrabble would involve far more than that. Here are some interesting \nparts of the script\n\n```\n  def permutations(letters) {\n    def powerset = powerset(letters)\n    def res = []\n    powerset.each {\n      def list = it.split(\"\") - \"\" as List\n      res << list.permutations().collect { it.join(\"\") }\n    }\n    return res.flatten()\n  }\n \n  def powerset(letters) {\n    def size = 2 ** letters.size()\n    def res = []\n    for (int i=0;i<size;i++) {\n      def tmp = \"\"\n      for (int j=0;j<letters.size();j++) {\n        if ( (i & (1<<j)) > 0) {\n          tmp += letters[j]\n        }\n      }\n      res << tmp\n    }\n    return res - \"\"\n  }\n```\n\nthis piece of code generates all the possible permutations from your letters. First you need to generate the power set of the letters so if you have the \nletters [a,b,c] you will need [a,b,c,ab,ac,bc,abc]. The power set also includes the empty set which is pointless here. A nice way of generating the\npower set is used here. You know that there are 2^n elements in the power set, so you start from 0 and go up to 2 ** n and for each number in the \nrange the bits of the number will represent which elements to take from the letters. So say you are 4 in the range, which is 010 in base 2. \nThis means that the 4th element in the power set is the 2 element from your letters. 5 is 011 which means the 5th element in the set is the \nfirst and second letters concatenated. Pretty cool way of doing it. Next we need all the permutations of all the elements in the power set. \nYou want to check for the words\n\n* a, b, c\n* ab, ba\n* ac ,ca\n* bc, cb\n* abc,acb,bca, etc..\n\nacross the board. \n\n```\ndef putWord(word, board, x, y) {\n    if (board[y][x] != ASTERISK) return null\n    //println \"tryword: $word x/y $x $y\"\n    def clone = clone(board)\n    def putat = x\n    for(int i=0;i<word.size();i++) {\n      while(putat < 14 && clone[y][putat] != \"*\") {\n        putat++\n      }\n      if (putat > 14) {\n        //putting the whole word would exceed board bounds\n        return clone\n      }\n      clone[y][putat] = word[i]\n      putat++\n    }\n \n    return clone\n   \n  }\n```\n\n\nthis piece of code will put the given word on the board. The thing you need to careful about is that you may need to skip over exiting letters from words.\n\n```\n\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|*  |a  |*  |*  |*  |*  | \n|*  |b  |*  |*  |*  |*  | \n|*  |c  |*  |*  |*  |*  | \n\n```\n\nif you want to put the word \"xyz\" at position 0,0 you need to skip over the letter a and then continue putting the word  so it looks like\n\n```\n| | | | | | |\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n|x|a|y|z|*|*| \n|*|b|*|*|*|*| \n|*|c|*|*|*|*| \n```\n\nif the starting location doesn't contain the * character you just just return as a word can't start there.\n\n```\n\ndef isValidWords(board, dict) {\n\tdef words = []\n\t  for (def line : board) {\n\t\tdef wl = line.join(\"\")\n\t\tdef st = new StringTokenizer(wl, \"*\")\n\t\twhile(st.hasMoreElements()) {\n\t\t\tdef nt = st.nextToken()\n\t\t\tif (nt.size() > 1) words << nt\n\t\t}\n     }\n \n \n \n    for (String w : words) {\n\t\tif (!dict.containsKey(w)) return false\n    }\n    return true\n  }\n\n```\n\nto check if the board is valid after you put a word you need to check that all the words on the board are in your dictionary, and that there are no \nextra islands on the board. The board is a 2D array like this\n\n```\n[\n [* * * * *],\n [* * * * *]\n...\n]\n```\n\nif you join each row of the board into a string and then tokenize on \"*\" you will get all the words in that row. Look them up in your dictionary and \nreturn false if a single words doesn't exists in the dictionary. What about vertical words? Just transpose the board (t_board[i][j] = board[j][i]) \nand run the same check.\n\n```\ndef connected(board) {\n    //dumpboard(board)\n    def startx, starty\n    outer:\n    for(int i=0;i<15;i++) {\n      for(int j=0;j<15;j++) {\n                  if (board[i][j] != ASTERISK) {\n                          startx = j\n                          starty = i\n                          break outer\n                  }\n      }\n    }\n    def clone = clone(board)\n    floodfill(clone, startx, starty)\n        for(int i=0;i<15;i++) for(int j=0;j<15;j++) if (clone[i][j] != ASTERISK && clone[i][j] != BANG) return false\n        return true\n    //return clone.flatten().findAll { it != ASTERISK && it != BANG }.size() == 0\n  }\n \n  def floodfill(board, x, y) {\n    board[y][x] = BANG\n    if (y < 14 && board[y+1][x] != ASTERISK && board[y+1][x] != BANG) {\n      floodfill(board, x, y+1)\n    }\n    if (y > 0 && board[y-1][x] != ASTERISK && board[y-1][x] != BANG) {\n      floodfill(board, x, y-1)\n    }\n    if (x < 14 && board[y][x+1] != ASTERISK && board[y][x+1] != BANG) {\n      floodfill(board, x+1, y)\n    }\n    if (x>0 && board[y][x-1] != ASTERISK && board[y][x-1] != BANG) {\n      floodfill(board, x-1, y)\n    }\n    //dumpboard(board)\n  }\n```\n\nto check for islands just find the indices of the first letter on the board, and do a flood fill, replacing the letters with the bang character. \nNext check all locations for a character other than \"!\" or \"*\". If there are any it means there is an island and the board isn't valid. \nI have a more detailed write up on this method [here][1]\n\nThe first iteration of the script ran on a single thread and would take about 6 to 7 minutes to calculate 13699 words.

So I thought it might be a nice way to waste a couple of hours trying to write a program that would give the highest scoring word given a board state. Most of the program is quite trivial in that it just has to generate permutations of the given letters and place them in all possible combinations on the board and then check if the board is valid. E.g that all the words on the board are in a dictionary and all the tiles are connected. The second part of the validity check is interesting. The first thing that popped to my mind was using a flood-fill algorithm starting from the tile nearest to the top-left corner. After the fill if there are any tiles on the board that are unmarked then there is more than 1 island on the board and the board is invalid. So how does a flood-fill algorithm work? Quite simple actually. You mark the current tile you are on at (x,y) and recurse to the neighbors if they are not empty, or have not been marked.

It just made sense to me at the time that a simple browser-as-an-OS device would enable me to do 90% of the things that I wanted. All the apps I use are web based \u2013 so that\u2019s covered, but what about being productive? What about managing servers? The ChromeOS team had that covered too with their SSH extension. But I can easily run a browser on my computer, why would I pay to get another device that just runs a browser. That\u2019s what had put me off of getting a Chromebook all this time, until a week ago when I finally gave in to the temptation after discovering the HP X2 on a review site. Buying the device is a story in its own. I started doing my research after I saw an add for the new Google slate. A tablet with a detachable keyboard was just the thing I needed when working on the couch. My 13\u201c Asus Zenbook is a bit too big when using on the couch although manageable but uncomfortable, so I was trying to get stuff done with an old iPad Air 2 fitted with a Zagg Rugged keyboard case. The keyboard on that is really small so extended typing/coding sessions would result in pains in my wrists. Not being able to remap the caps lock key to a control key made things worse, and the best SSH client Termius on iOS has the escape key on screen and not on the keyboard. Good-bye easy vim usage. \n\nSo this all made me start a search for a smaller more portable device. I checked out quite a lot of reviews for different devices on Amazon and the web. I\u2019m always skeptical towards the \u2018review sites\u2019 as I feel they can be bribed by companies for biased reviews so I always check out user experiences too. Almost all reviews on amazon for any Chromebook was fairly positive. So I had my mind set on a cheaper 12\u201d device around 200-300. The hardware on all these low-end devices are about the same so I was looking for a small bezel and nice looks. I told my SO about my intentions to switch to a low end Chromebook and the reply I got was \u201cYou always end up regretting those cheap purchases. Go for something better\u201d (my regrets so far: Asus EEE Pc, Gateway netbook, Amazon Fire tablet, Samsung Galaxy E tablet, \u2026). This actually got me encouraged to go for something better. The best Chromebook you can buy today is the Pixel which is ridiculously priced at 999 for the base model and is not a tablet. It looks sleek, but out of my price range. Next up according to some site was the HP X2. I hadn\u2019t actually checked this device out before so I started doing some research. No user reviews on amazon \u2013 bummer. BestBuy reviews were pretty good, site reviews were also pretty good. It\u2019s a tablet so that ticks a checkbox on my list. It\u2019s aspect ratio is 3:2 which is actually a great screen size for me. It supports android apps \u2013 this I though would be a must have if you are getting a new device. \n\nOne thing that bothered my was the faux leather textured keyboard, which I though would \u201cunnerdy\u201d and more \u201cbusinessy\u201d. The CPU is an Intel M3 mobile optimized chip which I have no idea about. The RAM is 4GB\u2019s and the storage is 32GB. Normally I would never get a device with 4GB of RAM but the beauty of the Chromebook is that it\u2019s efficient and 4GB is enough \u2013 at least that\u2019s what I had read in all the reviews. So I started hunting for a deal on this device. \n\nThe first time I checked BestBuy the device was listed for 530. 60 off the full price. I was like \u2018meh\u2019 I\u2019ll wait for Black Friday and see what happens. 2 days later it was full price again and this actually made me sad. That\u2019s when I realized that I wanted this \u2013 and I wanted it bad. I checked HP\u2019s official site and they still had a 50 promo going on until the 14th of November. In the hopes that Best Buy would price match I went to their Bellevue store. I located the device on display and played around with it. I also played around with the various other cheaper devices they had and the X2 and Pixel really stood out from that lot.\nThe cheaper displays looked foggy compared to the HP and Pixel. Anyways I found a sales person and asked them about the device, specifically if they would price match HP. To my dismay the guy said \u201cWe can\u2019t match the manufacturer only retailers\u201d. I tried a bluff with \u201cI\u2019ll buy it online from HP then\u201d and the guy said \u201cYeah makes sense\u201d. I guess they aren\u2019t flexible in that regard. So my head hanging low I walked out of the store empty handed back to my car. I sit in the car for 10 minutes and then think to my self: \u201cI\u2019ll pay the 50 premium for the luxury of an easy return if I don\u2019t like to device\u201d. This is both a \u201crationalization\u201d (or an excuse) and partially true. I went back into the store and found a different sales person. No way I\u2019ll swallow my pride and talk to the same guy after the bluff I pulled that backfired I just told the guy I wanted the x2 and he started searching for a box. He was looking at Samsung boxes checking their bar codes. I said \u201cWhy are you looking at Samsung boxes?\u201d and the reply was \u201cI want to make sure I get the code correct\u201d. I try to refrain from pushing people that misunderstand what I said as I see they get irritated when I immediately reiterate, so I waited 2, 3 minutes as he continued searching and then I said: \u201cWhy would they put an HP device in a Samsung box?\u201d. Then he understood what he was doing and apologized and started looking for other boxes. As his search continued without results I was starting to worry that they didn\u2019t have it stock. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time that it would happen to me, but luckily after a couple of more minutes of searching he found the correct item. A generic brown box with a HP logo on it. We went to the register and I paid the full price of 600$ + tax not being sure if it was money well spent.\n\n# Hardware\nAfter I got home I could only unbox the device before I had to do a diaper change or a feeding \u2013 I don\u2019t exactly remember. \n\nThe box isn\u2019t anything fancy like an Apple product but who cares? I\u2019d rather not pay extra for something that I\u2019ll end up throwing in the recycle anyways. After I put the family to sleep I got on my new toy and registered my google account and started playing around with it. The first thing that really impressed me was the screen. It\u2019s on par with a retina MacBook. The colors are vivid the fonts are crisp and the UI elements look beautiful. I\u2019ve used Windows and Linux machines with similar resolutions but no Windows machine could come close to a Mac before. But the X2 + ChromeOS are there \u2013 that\u2019s for sure. The device is usable on my lap as it doesn\u2019t need a kick-stand to stabilize the screen, but I does feel a bit unbalanced at times due to the screen being quite heavy as it has all the guts. The keyboard is not back-lit which I don\u2019t really care about as I\u2019m a touch typist and the keys are a joy to type on. I\u2019m usually a mechanical keyboard user and don\u2019t like mushy keyboards but this one is pleasant to use. The track pad is OK, it doesn\u2019t feel like a premium track pad like the one on the MacBook. There are 2 USB-C ports that can be used for charging and a 3.5 mm headphone jack on the side. I streamed some music from Spotify to my AudioTechnica ATH-50x headphones and Apple earbuds and the quality was good.\n\n# Software \nThe next day I got a chance to play around more with my new computer. I wanted to get my daily setup going and see if this machine was a keeper. Chrome is already setup with all my bookmarks and extensions synced automatically so that\u2019s done. I just needed a decent SSH client to connect to my development servers and start coding. I installed the Chrome SSH client extension first. This app is OK but it opens in a browser tab which is not the best for switching back and forth between web pages and the terminal. One thing that I couldn\u2019t accept with this app was that C-Space selection didn\u2019t work it Emacs. This would make my life significantly harder. So I tried ConnectBot and Termius from the app store. Both had weird rendering issues like the caret would be misaligned with the end of the text. This was not a show stopper but annoying. Next up was the Linux support through Crostini. The installs a VM / container and runs Linux apps. The only app I need was a terminal and it works great. The fonts are great, Emacs works as expected so I\u2019m basically setup for my daily work on my current project. Setting up my Samsung m2020 printer with Google cloud print was a breeze too. Just register from the web interface of the printer and its shows up in the print dialog. That\u2019s about it for the software I tested that doesn\u2019t work in browser.\n\n# Verdict\n \n Before I end this review, I also want to tell the rest of my story of my purchase. 2 days after I came home, during a late night feeding session I randomly checked the Best buy website and saw that they had a new promo going on: 100 off the full price! At first I felt so frustrated that I had missed this but then I remembered I could just return it and buy it again. I had already redeemed the 2 years 100 GB drive offer, I would probably lose that but I though I could give customer services a call and have them continue the drive offer. So I power washed the X2 put it back in it\u2019s box and went to Best Buy the next day. The customer services guy said that they\u2019ll price match themselves so I just got back my 100.\n\n A couple of things I still need to test are the active stylus and remote desktop connections via RDP/VNC. I\u2019ll post a reply on this topic once I\u2019ve done these. Today I managed to get X forwarding working running a X based emacs instance on my development server with the display forwarded to my X2. This is specific to this device but the ChromeOs in general. This opens the doors of the Linux applications to its fullest extent. I could even run heavy programs like IDEs on my server and use them without slowing down the X2. I\u2019ve also managed to create a desktop application launcher for the remote application which means there is no rogue terminal windows cluttering my Alt+Tab space. Another thing I did today was install Keepass Android from the play store on this machine. It works flawlessly and that put my mind at ease as I was kind of worried about not having my password manager on this. I\u2019m very satisfied and happy with this purchase for now. I still need to test it when I\u2019m not on my local network as X forwarding might be laggy beyond use over WAN \u2013 but I\u2019ll still have my good old terminal emacs locally.\n\n", "file": "hp_x2_chromebook_review.ipynb"}, {"title": "letterpress helper", "body": "\nLetterPress is a nice combination of Go and scrabble.

Finding bugs in this system notoriously\ndifficult as testing isn\u2019t done on behaviors but generated data. Verifying the\ndata against a source of truth is quite time consuming and I only have a\ncertain amount of time I can dedicate to manual testing. One of the defects\nthat caught my attention this week was stochastic signals firing for both\noversold and overbought on the same day, which is absolute non-sense. At first\nI thought it a date issue because the symbols I checked were from the top\ngainers and had huge increases that could pull up the stochastic from oversold\nto overbought in a day. My estimate was that the stochastic was oversold on day\nT-1 and became overbought on day T. But deeper investigation and hours of\ndebugging showed that this was not the case. The triggering code for the\nindicator is fairly straight forward\n\n```\nif (def.srt.contains(\u201coverbought\u201d) && d[len \u2013 2] < ob && ob < d[len \u2013 1]) {\n\nreturn new ScanResult(data, def);\n\n}\n\nif (def.srt.contains(\u201coversold\u201d) && d[len \u2013 2] > os && os > d[len \u2013 1]) {\n\nreturn new ScanResult(data, def);\n\n}\n\nif (def.srt.contains(\u201cneutral\u201d) && (d[len \u2013 2] > ob && ob > d[len \u2013 1]) ||\n\n(d[len \u2013 2] < os && os < d[len \u2013 1])) {\n\nreturn new ScanResult(data, def);\n\n}\n```\n\nThere is subtle bug in this code even though it looks quite simple. The 3rd\ncondition: a & b | c. The precedence order is equal for both operators so it\nwould trigger for both overbought and oversold\n\n\ufffc\n\nThe correct code is a & (b | c). Yet again the great syntax of Java produces a\nbug that is easy to miss and will make you go blind in the process. Well it did\ncost a couple of hours but at least it was an easy fix.\n\nAnother bug that I introduced during the performance evaluator developments\ncame to light after I tackled some optimization tasks on that module. I was\nexpecting way more scans to be score than there were which led me to\ninvestigate the scoring code that revealed a premature exit from the evaluation\nloop. A misplaced return statement instead of a continue statement was causing\nthe loop to terminate early and not score the remaining predictions. Another\neasy fix at least.\n\n## Optimizations\n\nOptimizations were the meat of this weeks work. Originally I thought that\nrunning the modules on a single thread with good caching would suffice in terms\nof performance but I was wrong.\n\nSo I went ahead to parallelize the portions of the modules that made sense.\nThese were\n\n\u2013 Performance Evaluations\n\u2013 Scans\n\u2013 Correlations processing\n\nThanks to Java 8 parallel streams this turned out to be quite easy. I just had\nto make sure that critical sections in code were atomic, and used classes that\nwere thread safe. One aspect to take into consideration is to preserve the\nlocality of the cache and not to evict items that from the cache only to have a\nsecond loop query that item again. So the order of processing is important.\n\nsymbols -> combos -> dates\n\nwill make sure that the cache contains the symbol data ready to be processed\nand will not run a DB query. Initially I had just parallelized the dates loop\nbut that loop doesn\u2019t contain enough data to make it worth while. The CPU cores\nwere only busy at 60% which is not ideal. So I moved the parallel streaming up\n2 levels to the symbol level which now utilized all cores at 100%. PerfEval and\nScans use the same code base so that was a bit easier than the Correlation\nProcessor that needed some extra attention due to memory issues. I operate\nunder a RAM constraint (because I need to keep server costs to a minimum) so I\nneeded to implement a specific cache for correlation calculations that just\nholds the last 30 closing prices and symbols.\n\nThe seconds area of optimization was for syncing data from IEX and running\nscans on the synced data. I currently orchestrate the module jobs via Jenkins\nand the pipeline only supports triggering based on a fail/success return code.\nThis means that every time I run a sync job, a scan job will trigger on success\n\u2013 even if there is no new data. It will just calculate the same results over\nand over again. This wasn\u2019t really a problem when the scan job only took a\ncouple of minutes to complete with 1 years worth of data but it doesn\u2019t work\nwith 5 years of data. So I implemented a check on the scan module that will\nonly run the scans if the latest scan date for a symbol is less than the latest\nOHLC date. The job will still run but it will just skip the scans so it takes\nonly about 3 \u2013 4 minutes to complete as opposed to 1 \u2013 1.5 hours. Another issue\nis with IEX not clearly defining when they will update the API with the days\nstock data. Previously I was fetching the data at 7 pm and 11 pm local time and\nprocessing the data even if the data was old (the one at 7 pm, they would have\nthe data updated by 11 pm for sure). But this means that the new scans/signals\nare not shown until almost 12 am which is less than ideal. I didn\u2019t want to\ncheck every hour or two because it would trigger the whole job pipeline and\nit\u2019s a lot of data to download. My solution to this came after I discovered an\nAPI endpoint that listed the symbols, which had a date field that showed the\ntime it was updated. Why didn\u2019t I just check a symbol for the last date?\nbecause at any given date a symbol may not be traded. The probability that AAPL\nnot being traded is rather low, but still I prefer a robust solution if there\nis one. The cost of making this API call to the symbol list is low, so now I\npoll every hour for new data between 4 pm \u2013 11 pm on the week days. There is\nstill no way to abort the pipe line without a failure on Jenkins but with the\nscan checking this is now less of a problem.\n\nA huge pain point was the duration of the Performance evaluation. I realized\nthis week that I was doing a lot unnecessary processing that was causing the\njob to take forever. I only needed to calculate performance for the scans that\nhad been triggered for that symbol, and I was running all the scans for that\nsymbol. Duh!\n\n\ufffc\n\nWith a new filter that skips scans that are not relevant and parallel\nprocessing the performance evaluation now takes 1 hour to complete which is\nreasonable. Even though I won\u2019t be running this job that often it kind of\nbecame my holy grail to optimize this. So looking back at the comments on the\nissue on gitea the first iteration resulted in 1K scored scans and 6K unscored\n(this was due to the bug I mentioned previously, which at the time I didn\u2019t\nknow). This was way to little so I thought I\u2019d throw more data at it and\nincreased the data interval to 5 years from 1. This increase resulted in 2.4K\nvs 6K. Still not good enough. After fixing the premature loop termination issue\nthe final ratio is 5K/6K which to me looks OK. It is possible that some scans\njust didn\u2019t occur frequent enough to be scored.\n\nThe DAO layer also got some love this week. I had previously implemented the\nDAO\u2019s in a way that each operation would open a new connection to the DB even\nthough this is not good practice. I didn\u2019t want to integrate a connection\npooling solution as the processes are not long lived so I just refactored the\nconnection objects to be reused class wide. I\u2019m using a relatively new SQL\nlibrary called sql2o which has a nice plain API for DB operations but the way\nthey implemented batch insertions is not optimal. It just wraps the inserts\naround a transaction and still inserts each row individually. MySQL\u2019s grouped\ninsert performs much better than this so I refactored batch inserts to generate\na grouped insert query. This increased performance of the inserts quite a bit,\neven though I didn\u2019t measure by how much.\n\nAfter examining the MySQL advisor on PhpMyAdmin I saw that it complained about\na lot of row sorting. The culprit was that each query to the OHLCV table needed\na sort by date for the caching and range query to work properly. The problem\nhere is that I already got the data sorted from the data API and lost that\ninformation after the insertion into the OHLCV table. I though about getting\nrid of the table and querying from the JSON data directly but some of the\nfunctions in the TOP module and market overview module take advantage of this\ntable to reduce the amount of code and off load processing to the database, so\nthe table had to stay. I stored the API response in K/V store only for query by\nthe ChartData component for caching. I also saw that selecting the last scan\ndate from the scan_result table for doing full table scans so I save those in\nthe K/V store too. This type of optimization can be good for performance but\nit\u2019s important not to let these data points get out of sync. I also implemented\na fall back mechanism to querying the DB if the value was not found in the K/V\nstore. This case can occur if a symbol is introduced and the last scan date is\nnot yet inserted.\n\nThe Jenkins job pipeline also needs to be separated by exchange to reduce the\namount of processing. This can be achieved by extracting the exchange parameter\nas a CLI parameter to the jobs. No need to run scans for IEX after BFX data\nsynced, just run the BFX scans\n\n\ufffc\n\n## Experiments\n\nI decided to change the way the prediction checker scores scans. My initial\nimplementation was exit on +/- 2 x ATR of the symbol. This yielded around 50%\naverage scores. Next I tried a 15 period low/high exit strategy. There is\nreally no correct way of doing this, as strategy is very personal. My reasoning\nwas that on an up trend the 15 period low would still decent gains and on a\ndown trend it would exit quite early to cut losses. After the performance\nevaluation runs the average score was 0.23959762958591568 and average error was\n0.17946781069881107 for a 95% confidence.\n\nI will still run the strategies of 2xATR, 3xATR and a percentage based exit to\ndetermine their outputs. Maybe running multiple strategies and selecting the\nbest performing one and showing that could also be a nice feature, but again\nit\u2019s very personal. I believe a 1:1 take profit / stop loss ratio will result\nin an average score of around 50%, and 2:1 will result with an average score of\n33% as it\u2019s basically based on expected value since the price changes are\ndistributed randomly.\n\nI also changed the way the Bollinger Bands squeeze scan was working. It was\nscanning the last N periods and triggering if the last period bands were within\na certain limit of the minimum band width of the last N periods. This is kind\nof over complicated as I just want to get the periods were the bandwidth is\nlow, so now it will trigger if the bandwidth is < 4%.\n\n## New features\n\nAs I was sifting through the scans I realized that I was looking for a chart to\nsee the relevant data that triggered the scan. If the scan is a Bollinger Bands\nsqueeze I wanted to the bands on the chart. So I added this feature. This\nrequired me to store the band data in the K/V store because that\u2019s the only\nstorage the API will access. To be consistent I also stored the last 100 period\nOHLC data in the K/V store to generate the candle stick data for the chart. The\nK/V store is backed by MySQL but this may change in the future. Redis is a\nstrong contender for K/V storage, but I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I get there.\nI added a new field to the scan definitions file that defines which indicators\nwill shown on the chart when that scan is triggered.\n\nHere is a screenshot of this new feature in action:\n\n![](/img/ts1.png)\n\nWow, yet another very long post for a short week. Looks like a lot has been\ndone and development is going full steam ahead.\n", "file": "techscan_devlog_2018-12-11.ipynb"}, {"title": "galaxy hyper lane generation", "body": "\nHyper lanes a.k.a Warp Lanes? What are those? They are a simple element of most space RTS/TBS games. They the lines that connect the stars. They are the highway lanes of spacetime, they enable spaceships to travel through them and guide the spaceships to their destination. They are a cheap alternative to wormhole generators which bend spacetime to connect stars. Here are what they look like from a popular game\n\n![](/img/58a34c67daa29.png)\n\nTechnically speaking they are edges (the lines) between vertices (stars). What we need to do is generate these edges given a set of vertices and there a couple of methods for doing this. The first one that pops up is to generate a minimum spanning tree. But a minimum spanning tree would look this\n\n![](/img/58a34d26a9467.png)\n\nand this doesn't exactly look like a nice interstellar highway as we would like to be able to travel to a couple of nearby stars from our origin star. This way when we are trying to reach a distant star we have multiple options of getting to that star. Image that you did your warp lanes using an MST and you want to get from star A to star D and the only path is A -> B -> C -> D. What do you do if there is an enemy fleet in the star C system and you don't want to engage that fleet with your science ship? Observe that the MST has only 1 connection between 2 neighboring stars so there is no way for you to do that.\n\nSo here is a naive algorithm I came up with\n\n1. let S be a list star with random coordinates in a 1000x1000 plane\n2. for each star in S\n     1. if star was visited before, skip it\n     2. get the N closest stars to this star\n     3. add a connection from this star to its neighbors\n     4. add a connection from each neighbor to this star\n\nthe get closest star also needs some attention as we don't want to return a close neighbor if it already has a connection to the current star.\n\n1. filter out all other stars except our current star\n2. filter out all stars that already have a connection with the current star\n3. map the remaining stars as a tuple of ( distance to source, this star)\n4. sort by the distance\n5. take N closest and return the stars from the tuple\n\nThe N parameter determines the number of max connections going out from a star.\nHere is an image of this algorithm with N=5\n\n![](/img/58a34f85a5be6.png)\n\nThis does look a bit better but there are too many cramped points where it's hard to tell what's going on. The stars are too close to each other so we need some kind of regulation when generating the random points for the stars. One way of doing this is checking the \"star density\" when generating the star and only placing the star if it's acceptable. This basically means not placing a star to close another and we can do this by checking if the generated star falls within a range of existing stars. That would be done by checking if it lies in a circle of radius R with the star at its origin. \n\n1. let S be a list of stars initially empty\n2. while S size < number of stars to generate\n3. generate a random point in the plane\n4. if this point satisfies the density condition add the star to S\n\nOne point to note about this algorithm is that it has the possibility of never terminating if the density conditions are too strict and it cannot find a good place for the next star. So it's a good idea to add a loop counter check that will terminate with an exception after a number of tries and tell the user to relax the number of stars and the radius R. The acceptable density function can be done as follows\n\n1. let R be the minimum distance that two stars should be apart (which is the radius R)\n2. for each star already generated check if (src.x - star.x)^2 - (src.y - star.y)^2 < R^2\n3. if there are stars that satisfy this equation then the density condition is not satisfied.\n\nAfter adding the density check and reducing N to 3 the lines look a bit clearer.\n\n![](/img/58a352d019823.png)\n\nThere is a fundamental error in this approach. If you select a low N (connectivity value) then you sometimes will get disconnected stars like this\n\n![](/img/58a36eaca414e.png)\n\nTo address this issue a combination of an MST and the naive approach could work. \n\n![](/img/58a36f7ad5694.png)\n\nNow that the MST guarantees that all the graph will be connected we have addressed the issue but still, the layout doesn't look good for efficient traveling. We still could use more triangulation that is more lanes connecting nearby stars. Using the closest N method led to a cluttered layout. The cause of this clutter is that if 2 stars are almost in a straight line and are the 2 closest stars, there will 2 connections to these stars that overlap.\n\n![](/img/58a37252c62a7.png)\n\nYet another way of connecting the stars would be to use Delaunay Triangulation. This also produces a very nice warp lane structure but still, has the cluttering problem due to the star layout. \n\n![](/img/58a37861e14cc.png)\n\nNow let's address the clutter problem. It seem that the warp lanes look cluttered if there are neighboring stars too close to an existing warp lane.\n\n![](/img/58a385c4c845c.png)\n\nthe green arrow shows a lane we could do better without. How can we detect these lanes? Just from the definition of the problem. If a neighbor star is too close to a lane, drop the existing lane so the closer lane to the a star will remain. Here is a simple outline for the algorithm that requires a bit of linear algebra:\n\n1. Sort all the neighbors for each star is descending order according to their distance from the origin star.\n2. for each neighbor i to all neighbors - 1\n    1. for each neighbor j from i + 1 to all neighbors\n    2. if the distance of neighbor i from the lane between origin star and neighbor j < some threshold T discard the lane\n\ncalculating the distance of a point P0 to a line given by P1 and P2 is\n\n$$ \\bigl|\\frac{(y_2 - y_1) \\times x_0 - (x_2 - x_1) \\times y_0 + x_2 \\times y_1 - y_2 \\times x_1}{\\sqrt{(y_2-y_1)^2 + (x_2-x_1)^2}}\\bigr| $$\n\nHere is the result of a relaxed threshold that will draw a lot of lanes\n\n![](/img/58a3871f9072d.png)\n\nhere are the same results with a stricter threshold that has discarded the middle lane\n\n![](/img/58a387534357e.png)\n", "file": "galaxy-hyper-lane-generation.ipynb"}, {"title": "techscan devlog 2018-12-03", "body": "\nA new month a new dev log for the stuff that\u2019s been going on\n\nHuge change yet again for the engine which I will get into later. First order\nof business is a summary of the new stuff:\n\n## Summary\n\n1. get rid of all but USD pairings for cryptos\n2. reduce symbol listing response size from 1.2M to 0.8M\n3. new scanner: trend start\n4. S/R zones to charts\n5. using TaLib java API\n6. Candle stick patterns scanners\n7. port back over to java w/o spring + hibernate\n8. eclim, idea + X forward, Che adventures\n9. market overview calculations in SQL\n10. store technical calculations in KV store\n11. correlation calculations in technical calculations\n\n## Good bye pairings\n\nSome of the alt coins are worth so less that compared with BTC they end up\ntaking 8-9 decimal places. This is a disaster for the display and the layout of\nthe app in general. At first I had thought about displaying these types of\ncurrency pairs as satoshis but that was met with high resistance from my\nprevious team members. The pair name is XXX/BTC so you cannot display it in\nSatoshi\u2019s was the justification. Fair enough I guess. Another fix for this\ncould be decreasing the font size if there are a lot of decimal places, but I\nhave tried this. It sounds like it should work in theory but I\u2019d have to\nexperiment with it to be convinced that it does. So for the time being the\neasiest solution is to drop pairings with BTC and keep only the pairs that are\ntraded against the USD. All of the big coins are included in this so no big\nloss their.\n\n## Slim responses\n\nThe autocomplete component of Vuetify requires a list of the items to complete\n(though I\u2019m pretty sure their should be a version that can do partial searches\nwith AJAX) and that list in the previous version was huge around 1.2 megabytes.\nThe initial delay after the autocomplete trigger was around 2 seconds which\nmade it appear to be not responding. My primary solution to this was to trigger\na request to the symbol listing endpoint after the app loaded in the background\nand since requests are cached the searches would not have that initial lag.\nThis worked out like I thought but the payload size is still more than I cared\nfor so I got rid of some of the fields in the response and change the structure\nfrom a JSON object to an array dropping the keys and therefore reducing the\nsize even further.\n\n## More scanners\n\nA saw a scanner on STB that I wanted to incorporate as I think it\u2019s important:\nThe new trend started scanner. It fires when the ADX crosses the 25 line. Even\nthough ADX lags it\u2019s still useful to know that a trend has begun.\n\n## More charts\n\nData visualizations are always cool, you can never get enough of them. This\nmotivated me to add a chart displaying the support and resistance zones\ncalculated using the clustering method I blogged about a couple of weeks back.\n\n![](/img/ts2.png)\n\nI plan on adding charts to each triggered scan with the relevant indicators\nlike MA\u2019s for MA crossovers etc. But it\u2019s a low priority task right now.\n\n## New technical analysis library\n\nTa-lib.org is a mature technical analysis library that supports way more\nindicators that I built into talib4j. I was quite happy with the results I got\nwhen\n\nusing the python wrapper so it\u2019s back in. I plan on doing a write up on the\nperformance vs talib4j as the code is probably transpiled from the C version\nand impossible to read. The Java API is god awful because of this generated\ncode, which means the C API is just as disgusting. To limit the exposure to\nthis filth I wrapper the API with a custom class and I can just substitute that\nfor talib4j any time if I have all the indicators coded in.\n\n## Even more scanners\n\nUsing Talib also gives me access to candle pattern recognition. I didn\u2019t want\nto write a scanner for each of the patterns so I had to resort to using the\njava reflection API to figure out the correct method to call from the scan\ndefinition file. So the definition file is something like this:\n\n``` { \u201cid\u201d: \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cname\u201d: \u201csome scanner\u201d: \u201cmodule\u201d: \u201cCDL2CROWS\u201d } ```\n\nI had all the definitions generated from the documentation on the talib site\nwith a small python script (around 60 different scans) and look up the method\nfrom the module attribute of the definition. With the addition of all the\ncandle patterns each run consists now of around 16K scans!\n\n## Back to the drawing board\n\nNow that I am running 16K scans the python code took 48 hours to complete a\ndays worth of scans. This of course is unacceptable as the scans need to be\ndone quickly. It\u2019s no use to display scans 2 days after the market closes. I\npoked around with multi threading in the python code but to no avail as there\nis this thing called the \u201cGlobal Interpreter Lock\u201d which limits you to the\ntotal performance of a single core. Also using multi threaded code consume too\nmuch memory \u2013 something which I will not have that much of in production. So\nback to a faster language: Java. But this time I didn\u2019t want all the bloat that\ncomes with spring + hibernate. They consume way too much memory that was one of\nthe reasons for going with python. So this time around it\u2019s a plain old Java\napplication with small utility libraries for database operations. Now 16K scans\ntake 1 hour to complete without multi threaded code. I was initially thinking\nof keeping the python engine for other stuff like synchronization, and\ntechnical calculations etc. but ended up porting all the engine code back to\nJava.\n\n## Have Chromebook will code\n\nI got a new toy from the Black Friday sales events so naturally I want to use\nit all the time. But it\u2019s not buffed in terms of hardware so I needed to find a\nway of coding Java without running a full blown IDE on my Chromebook. It would\nprobably run the IDE OK but the engine + database would put to much strain and\nit would start to crawl. So I started coding in Emacs. Plain old Emacs with no\npackages. It sounds crazy and it actually is quite crazy. It was nice just\nsuspending the machine and reattaching the session to continue where I left\noff, but no syntax checking, not auto imports makes it a hassle. Not being able\nto see the parameters of a method call was the worst. So I checked out what\npackages people were using for coding on Emacs. The most effective one seemed\nto be Eclim. I had used Eclim before with vim (which is the original purpose of\nEclim: Eclipse + vim) but somebody had wrote a wrapper around the binary for\nEmacs. I tried to get it running on my Debian development server but I could\nnot get it to work. It would just not connect. So I gave up on Eclim and\nchecked out another package called Megahanada. Found that one too complicated\nand didn\u2019t really find the functions it provided useful. Then I tried X\nforwarding with Intellij Idea. This felt like home a familiarity that was much\nappreciated. This lasted for a week or 2 until the inefficient X protocol drove\nme nuts with the stupid lagging of the UI. I looked around for some\nalternatives and came across xpra which was supposed to be faster but really\nwasn\u2019t. And the fonts and graphics were blurry with Xpra so it went out the\nwindow. I thought that maybe it was Swing that wasn\u2019t playing nicely so I tried\nX forwarding with VS Code. Same problems. But on a side note I really liked the\nJava plugin for VS Code \u2013 it\u2019s lightweight and provides all the great\nfunctionality that I was searching for. Anyways then I remembered Eclipse Che \u2013\nA web based IDE. I had tried Che before in it\u2019s early stages and wasn\u2019t really\nimpressed with it\u2019s current state. But know they\u2019ve created a Docker image\nwhich is super easy to install and get running and they\u2019ve also added Git\nsupport so worst I could use Che to write the code push and compile/test on my\ndevelopment server. But Che workspaces already come with Java + Maven so I\ncould basically do everything I wanted in the Che environment. Another bad\nthing with X Forwarding was that once the laptop suspended the SSH connection\nwas lost and the applications died on me. Since I have leave the computer to do\nother stuff (like burping, diaper changes, etc) this was bugging me quite a\nbit. Now in Che the tab remains open and I can continue where I left off\nwithout a problem.\n\n## Bugs bugs bugs\n\nPorting over code is also a great chance to check what I\u2019ve actually written. I\nfigured out major bugs in the technical calculations code which I fixed. I was\ndoing all of these calculations in application code, which is probably slower\nthan doing them on the DB side so I moved the things I could calculate on the\nDB over there.\n\n## few architectural changes\n\nI was letting the API calculate some of the data on the symbol detail view on\nthe fly, but now I decided to have these pre-calculated for the last trade date\nand store them in the key/value store. I really wan\u2019t refrain from having the\nAPI do calculations to consolidate all the logic on the engine code base. This\nmeant moving the technical and overview tab data to the key/value store. I also\nwanted to merge these to requests as they did have a couple of overlapping\nvalues. I also decided to store the correlation data in the key/value store as\nit was taking up a lot of rows in the table. I was keeping a history of the\ncorrelated items which is probably not necessary. While at it I also removed\nthe dedicated job for correlated calculations and merged it into the technical\ncalculations.\n\nWow that was quite a long post \u2013 a lot has happened in the past week.\n", "file": "techscan_devlog_2018-12-03.ipynb"}, {"title": "ittb devlog 2018-04-19", "body": "test playing the new turn based tower defense game which I have not yet dubbed\nand shall refer to as TBTD for short I came to the conclusion that levels were\ntoo easy. Adding more enemies is the first thing that popped into my mind but\nthat doesn\u2019t make the game interesting, it only makes it tedious. In the first\nround of the prototype I had the targeting set to all neighbor tile at a\ndistance of 1 tile.\n\nSo diagonal attacks were possible. Changing this rule to only cardinal\ndirections increased the difficulty quite a bit. Also I came up with the\nfollowing mechanic: The player has 2 types of attacks. Ranged and melee. If you\nare standing next to an enemy you default to a melee attack.\n\nYou cannot use a ranged attack. If you are not next to the enemy it\u2019s a ranged\nweapon attack (if you have one). Since ranged attack will not displace the\nenemy it becomes a tactical decision to use a ranged attack and keep you Mech\nsafe or go up to the enemy to displace it. This did add a variety to the\ntactical decision needed. GO refactored the attack code into a weapons class,\nso we have the foundation to add different types of weapons into the game.\n\nThe pilot weapons are the Punch and Auto-cannon with different damages /\nranges. \n\nAs the turns progress new enemies spawn. The current method for doing this is a\nprobabilistic method and the chances to spawn an enemy increase with each turn\nthat an enemy is not spawn. If an enemy does spawn, the chance reduces. So if\nthe game drags on your chances of clearing the level decrease quite a bit which\nforces the player to act quickly. I\u2019m also thinking of adding a turn counter to\nmake some levels survival mode levels.  \n\nOne feedback I got was that the levels become repetitive after a certain while,\nespecially if there is going to be the concept of permanent death, which I\nactually find appealing. Random level generation is out of the question as\nrandom is random, and not nice to play. So going through some procedural level\ncontent designs, I came up with the idea of constructing the levels in chunks.\nEach level consists of a combination of 4 chunks to choose from N. \n\nThis can yield different level topology and game play. We\u2019ll need to test this\nto see how it goes. \n\nWe discussed the concept of salvaging enemies at the end of each level\n(looting) for better weapons and upgrades. This also looks like a promising\nmechanic.  \n\nFor this to be meaningful, I will also need to implement some kind of\nprocedural weapon generator which I need look into.\n", "file": "ittb_devlog-2018-04-19.ipynb"}, {"title": "chained ajax calls", "body": "\nSometimes you want to make successive calls to multiple urls one after another - not in parallel.

api call and logs the key pressed into a file. A very simple key-logger if you will. The codes logic is pretty simple i think, you just reroute the original api call to yours, do the stuff you want and then call the original api method. The method used here is a method provided by the windows api, so there is nothing illegitimate with the method. But thebad news is that this type of hooking is only supported for hooking messages between windows and not gdi32 api calls, which we need. So we can't use this method on a poker room client, that disguises its log text\n\n\n## Trying it Under Wine\n\nAfter failed attemps on win32 API programming I came up with the ingenious idea of running the poker desktop clients on linux, under the wine win32 API emulator.\u00a0 We had a discussion about the pro/cons of this approach.\nPros:\n* wine is open source, so easy access to the API implementation to override custom windows stealth behaviours.\n* No need to avoid poker room clients detection attempts, everything is in the wine source code\nLinux environment\n\nCons:\n* Probably no source code to examine, need to hack wine codes by ourselves\n* User input simulation still remains a mystery\n\n\nInstalling wine under debian etch, was quite easy. I just grabbed the source from the sourceforge page and untarred it. The configure script keeps bugging you for the dependencies, which where lib-png, lib-jpeg, flex, bison, libxml2 for me,on a minimal desktop installation of debian. The build time takes quite a while, ~1,5 million lines of code, but completes without errors.\nNext up, download the pokerroom executable from their page, and run it under wine. Wine complained about missing DLLs such as mfc 4.2 and visual C runtime files. To satisfy this hunger we used winetricks from http://www.kegel.com/winetricks which is a small script that downloads and install the dependecy DLLs.\nWhen you fire up wine, the poker room client executes complaining about some DLL being old, which is not important.

So we have to hook the text displaying portion of the operating systems API, in this case the wine API.\nThis method resides in the file dlls/user32/text.c. For testing purposes add the following line into DrawTextExW():\n\n```\nFIXME(\"%s, %d, [%s] %08x\\n\", debugstr_wn (str, count), count,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 wine_dbgstr_rect(rect), flags);\n```\n\nNow save the file and exit. Run the poker room client with wine, and watch the terminal output a lot of messages. Login to your account and sit at a table.\nIf you watch the terminal log, you'll see messages flying by with every little piece of text that is ever drawn on to the wine windows. This includes the game log that we are interested in. Now there are a few problems that we can identify here:\n\n* we don't want to receive messages from the lobby windows, including garbage chat conversations.\n* Poker room developers tried make our lives harder by calling drawText for every word instead of sentences.\n* There are duplicate messages all over the place\n\nThis is a screen shot of where we are now:\n\n![](/img/pokebot.png)\n\n## The Brain\nBefore setting out to code and getting our hands dirty, the most scary part seemed to me the win 32 API stuff, probably because I've been a linux console/web programmer all my life, and i was never into windows and desktop client, especially low level - unmanaged windows API calls. But it seems there are a lot of resources and documents, and even managed code that hooks API calls (discussed in a different chapter). The real beast is the brain, the decision making part, the AI Server.\n\nFirst off before discussing the actual algorithms and techniques, lets dicuss the architecture, and why it is called the AI Server. Simple: we'll have multiple poker room clients, playing on mutliple tables, some times even 2 of our bots playing on the same table, and sharing data, though one might think that this would decrease the winnings, and giving more rake, but this would increase our chances of winning more money from the other players. AI algorithms should be changable and tunable on the fly, and yet per AI Client (the Agent) configurable. The best design decision seemed like a client/server model, where the server was the AI Server, and the clients were the agents, that were the gateway between the AI and the poker room client. The AI Server's architectural crude design is like this:\n[AIServer Diagram in Omnigraffle]\n\nFlexibilty is a key design objective in most of the projects that get designed. This also was the case in the AI Server. Different algorithms had to be pluggable as modules, changeable according to table characteristics (heretic players, tight players, etc.) without the need of recompilation of code.\n\nMulti-thread is a core requirement, because we'll be serving a lot of requests and clients\n\nCheating and using a application container such as tomcat doesn't help because HTTP is a stateless protocol, and poker is a statefull game. The state will have to be carried out by URL parameters or session/cookies which means that the agent will need to implement a HTTP client, which is not worth the effort. Instead we designed our own text based communication protocol. The protocol is TCP and Text based. Very simple, clients send commands and the server threads act accordingly.\n\n", "file": "how_to_pokebot.ipynb"}, {"title": "movement improvements", "body": "\non the last movement post I mentioned some of the improvements that I would be \nmaking to the ship movements.

I also added validation for command\u2192components mappings. \nSo you can\u2019t go around trying to issue a move command to a ship that doesn\u2019t have\nan engine.\n\nIssuing move commands can get confusing when there are 30.000 planets to choose from. \nThe empires will have the location of all stars in the galaxy but they still need\nto survey the system to get specifics. Ships now have a sensor component that will\nlimit the range it can navigate.\n\nI also tidied up the parameters being passed to the endpoints using the great\nspring provided argument resolvers. This makes the controller layer code so\nmuch cleaner, a pleasure to work with. I also went ahead and restructured the \npackage layout by functionality instead of application layers. There is no best\npractice for this so I\u2019m trying out this type of structuring.\n\nNow that the backend processing for commands is in place, the client needed \nsome attention.

The correct path is the path with the purple arrows. How to you choose these? Well luckily there are a couple of ways. The brute force version would be to do a breadth first search to find the target cell which would lead to wasted movements for sure. The next best approach is the select the next cell in the BFS not at random or in order but based on a heuristic, a good guess to which cell would lead quicker to the target cell. The easiest heuristic that comes to mind is the hex distance calculated as Math.max( x2-x1, y2-y1, z2-z1). You also add the total cost of movement to this cell, something that you know for sure. Why do we add the cost of movement? Because we may need a rotation to get to that neighbor cell, which is also a movement cost. So from the starting cell, you look at all the neighbors and calculate the distance to the target cell + the cost of movement to that cell and choose the closest one. You add the current cell to the visited list. Why? because in the next step the current cell will show up as a neighbor, and we don\u2019t want to check that cell again. Then you advanced to that cell and do the same until you have reached your target. Is it possible that the target cell is never found or a ship will be there to block us? No because the target cell validity check is done before hand (the green cells). This is a simplified version of the A-start algorithm.

It works in the following way:\n\n* each planet has a population point\n* this point is increased/decreased based on food surplus on the planet\n* there is a population score that is calculated based on the number of existing populations on the planet\n* if the population points of a planet are > then the population score a new population is born.\n\t\nThe exact formula (each day the population point is adjusted like this):\nx = food surplus (production \u2013 consumption)\nimage was lost\nthe result is added to the current planet population points. if (population points > nextScore) grow new population on an empty tile nextScore is calculated as 1.65p + p^1.12 where p is the current population If a new population spawns it prefers a tile with resources.

Galaxies \nare made up of stars systems. The galaxies are in radial form, maybe I might consider adding a spiral\nform \u2013 but not a priority. The different forms of galaxies should affect FTL traveling.\n\n\n## Star systems\nThe galaxy is filled with star systems that are distributed according to a simple density \nfunction so that no 2 systems are within a certain range of each other. Star systems contain \nplanets which the players will exploit and colonize to further their ambitions. Star systems \nare connected by Warp lanes. No system is isolated, meaning that you can travel to any star \nfrom any star.\n\n\n## Planets\nPlanets contain\n  * orbital resources\n  * surface resources\norbital resources will be mined by mining stations, surface resources are collected by colonization of the planet. \nThe planet surface is split up into tiles. Populations and building will be built on these tiles to gather their resources.\n\n\n## Resources\nThere are 5 types: Energy, mineral, society, physics, engineering. Energy and minerals can be stockpiled, \nthe research resources cannot. Buildings, ships etc. will cost resources as will researching technologies.\n\n\n## Ships Designs\nShip designs are blueprints for creating ships. Ships consist of 1 to 3 sections called the core, \nbow, stern section. Each section contains a hull with different slot assignments. Slots may be \nsmall, medium or large and contain components. Components contain attributes and a value for that\nattribute. E.g a power core component contains a power output attribute which a ship will need to\ngenerate power for weapons or survey equipment etc.\n\nThis is a summary of the current progress. Now let\u2019s talk about some of the things I implemented today.\nThe game progresses in turns, which are automatically incremented at 1 turn per 10 seconds on the \nserver side. Each turn planetary resources of the colonized planets are gathered and the costs are\nsubtracted from these. Initially, I had 5 integers representing the resources on the planets, but \nthis turned out to be cumbersome when tallying the resources so I changed this to a ResourceDeposit\nobject with a type and amount attribute on each planet. This way I can just map the amount for an \nattribute type for each planet and just reduce them.\n\nRandom numbers determine quite a bit of how a galaxy is created, but I needed a stable environment\nfor integration testing so I moved the Random class to a spring service which I can seed with a number\nso that it generates the same numbers each time.\n\nWhen a player joins a galaxy some initial processing like creating the template ship designs and \nassigning a home planet must be done. When assigning a home planet an initial population of half \nof the tiles with resources is placed on the best tiles. Best tiles are the tiles with the most \namount of resources independent of the resource type. So it\u2019s pure chance if you end up on tiles \nwith energy or minerals. You can still relocate a population to another tile at any time but that \nwill have a happiness cost which in turn will reduce their productivity for some time.\n\nGather resources from a tile only makes sense if there is a population on it. Also the productivity \nof the population should play a part in what percentage of the resources are gathered per turn, \nsomething is waiting to be implemented. Also added some simple client UI to see the summary and the \nsurface tiles of a planet, check the image attachments on the page at the bottom. It\u2019s fun to see how \nthe UI evolves over time. One thing to mention when developing the UI is the importance of persisting \nthe logged in user session, so that you don\u2019t have to login every time you restart the application. \nI used to use in memory maps to persist session data but after a short while having to login constantly \ngets annoying so now I default to persisting sessions to the DB or maybe Memcache/Couchbase when \nrunning in production.\n\nHere is how all this stuff is linked together in the DB\n\n![](/img/ep4xdl1-2.jpeg)\n\n![](/img/ep4xdl1-1.jpeg)\n\n", "file": "epic4x-2017-02-24.ipynb"}, {"title": "pgn parser with comments and recursive variations support", "body": "\nPGN files are the standard way chess games are transmitted across the net. So any chess program that needs to replay or process a game needs to be able to read the PGN format.\nThere are very many different PGN parsers around in different programming languages. Most of them try to process the PGN using regexes, or just reduce the data to the main\nline moves, event discarding the comments and annotations. This may be OK if you are processing the game for purposes of machine consumption as the comments don't mean\nanything to a machine but I wanted to write a parser that preserves the comments and the recursive variations. \n\nSo the first part of any non trivial parser is going to be a \"Lexer\" that tokenizes the input. Check out the PGN formal grammar for \nANTLR (https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/blob/master/pgn/PGN.g4) that has a details. \nIt's a good idea to use this ANTLR code to if you don't want to fiddle with insides of a parser. \n\nSo the lexer will consume the input character by character creating tokens from this input. Here is the token class that I used:\n\n<pre>\n    public class Token\n    {\n        public string Type { get; }\n        public string Value { get; }\n        public const string MoveNumber = \"MoveNumber\";\n        public const string SAN = \"SAN\";\n        public const string Comment = \"Comment\";\n        public const string EOF = \"EOF\";\n        public const string Result = \"Result\";\n        public const string Header = \"Header\";\n        public const string NAG = \"NAG\";\n        public const string LPAREN = \"LPAREN\";\n        public const string RPAREN = \"RPAREN\";\n        public Token(string type, string value)\n        {\n            Type = type;\n            Value = value.Replace(\"\\n\", \"\");\n        }\n\n        public override string ToString()\n        {\n            return \"Token \" + Type + \" \" + Value;\n        }\n    }\n</pre>\n\nWe need to treat the left parenthesis and the right one as individual tokens as they will have a special meaning when we are creating the syntax tree. \n\nDiving deeper into the Lexer:\n\n<pre>\n        private int _position = 0;\n        private Char _currentChar;\n        private string _text;\n        private Boolean _lexingDone;\n\n        public PgnLexer(string pgnText)\n        {\n            _text = pgnText;\n            if (_text.Length > 0)\n                _currentChar = _text[_position];\n        }\n</pre>\n\npretty simple, we need to do some book keeping - the current character pointer and the input data is stored.\n\n<pre>\n        private void Advance()\n        {\n            _position += 1;\n            if (_position >= _text.Length)\n            {\n                _lexingDone = true;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                _currentChar = _text[_position];\n            }\n        }\n</pre>\n\neach time we consume a character the Advance() method will increment the pointer and check if all the input has been consumed. \n\n<pre>\n        private void SkipWhitespace()\n        {\n            while (!_lexingDone && \n                   (Char.IsWhiteSpace(_currentChar) || \n                                    _currentChar == '.' || \n                                    _currentChar == '\\n'))\n            {\n                Advance();\n            }\n        }\n</pre>\nSome PGN files are transcribed by humans and contain multiple whitespaces, some are computer programs inserting optional white spaces for\nbetter readability etc. The '.' character is also treaded as a white space as the move indication \"2... c4\" has multiple '.'\ncharacters that we'll skip.\n\n<pre>\n        public Token GetNextToken()\n        {\n            string result = \"\";\n            while (!_lexingDone)\n            {\n                //result += _currentChar;\n                if (_currentChar == '(')\n                {\n                    Advance();\n                    SkipWhitespace();\n                    return new Token(Token.LPAREN, result);\n                }\n\n                if (_currentChar == ')' && result.Trim().Equals(\"\"))\n                {\n                    Advance();\n                    SkipWhitespace();\n                    return new Token(Token.RPAREN, result);\n                }\n\n                if (_currentChar == '[')\n                {\n                    Advance();\n                    while (_currentChar != ']')\n                    {\n                        result += _currentChar;\n                        Advance();\n                    }\n                    Advance();\n                    SkipWhitespace();\n                    return new Token(Token.Header, result);\n                }\n                if (_currentChar == '.')\n                {\n                    SkipWhitespace();\n                    return new Token(Token.MoveNumber, result);\n                }\n\n                if (_currentChar == '{')\n                {\n                    while (_currentChar != '}')\n                    {\n                        Advance();\n                        result += _currentChar;\n                    }\n                    Advance();\n                    return new Token(Token.Comment, result.Replace(\"{\",\"\").Replace(\"}\",\"\"));\n                }\n\n                if ( (_currentChar == '\\n' ||_currentChar == ' ' || _currentChar == ')') && !result.Trim().Equals(\"\"))\n                {\n                    SkipWhitespace();\n                    result = result.Trim().Replace(\" \", \"\").Replace(\"\\n\", \"\");\n                    if (result.Equals(\"1-0\") || result.Equals(\"0-1\") || result.Equals(\"1/2-1/2\") || result.Equals(\"*\"))\n                        return new Token(Token.Result, result);\n                    if (result.StartsWith(\"$\"))\n                    {\n                        return new Token(Token.NAG, result);\n                    }\n                    return new Token(Token.SAN, result);\n                }\n\n                result += _currentChar;\n                Advance();\n\n            }\n            if (result.Equals(\"\"))\n                return new Token(Token.EOF, \"\");\n            return new Token(Token.Result, result);\n        }\n</pre>\n\nthis is the real part that does the tokenization. Parenthesis type characters are consumed until the matching one is found, \notherwise we consume until we reach a character that terminates a move element and return the resulting token. \nIf we have consumed all the input we return the game result. Some PGN files may have extra white spaces at the end, \nso we return an EOF token if that's the case.\n\n\nNow that we can fetch the tokens from the file, we need to construct a tree representing the moves, comments, variations etc. in the PGN file. \n\n<pre>\n        private readonly PgnLexer _lexer;\n        private Token _currentToken;\n\n        public PgnParser(PgnLexer lexer)\n        {\n            _lexer = lexer;\n            _currentToken = lexer.GetNextToken();\n        }\n</pre>\n\nWe need to track the currentToken and pass a reference to our lexer to fetch more tokens. \n\nThis method will \"eat\" through the tokens and allow us to move forward in the processing:\n\n<pre>\n        private void Eat(string tokenType)\n        {\n            if (_currentToken.Type.Equals(tokenType))\n            {\n                _currentToken = _lexer.GetNextToken();\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                throw new Exception(\"Invalid syntax\");\n            }\n        }\n</pre>\n\nTake for example this made up PGN move text:\n\n\"1.e4 (11. f3 (111. f4 a7) a6) 1... e5 2.f4 exf4 (220... exf3) (221... exf2) 3.Nf3 g5 4.h4 ...\"\n\n(The move numbers are not correct even the moves may be illegal but the purpose is to illustrate the tree that we are aiming to build.)\n\nWe want to transform this into the following tree:\n\n\n![image http://forum.dizman.org/assets/images/1-P17kH330Z1CMJ5qF.png](/img/1-P17kH330Z1CMJ5qF.png)\n\nAll vertical connections are the next node connections and the horizontal connections are the variation connections. So \"e4\" move spawns a variation \nthat it self has an embedded variation (hence the name recursive variations). The move \"exf4\" spawns 2 variations at this move. \n\nSo we start with a method to transform the current token to a node:\n\n<pre>\n private Node Element()\n        {\n            if (_currentToken.Type.Equals(Token.SAN))\n            {\n                Node node = new SanNode();\n                node.Value = _currentToken.Value;\n                return node;\n            }\n\n            if (_currentToken.Type.Equals(Token.Result))\n            {\n                return new ResultNode();\n            }\n\n            if (_currentToken.Type.Equals(Token.MoveNumber))\n            {\n                var node = new MoveNumberNode();\n                node.Value = _currentToken.Value;\n                return node;\n            }\n\n            if (_currentToken.Type.Equals(Token.Header))\n            {\n                var node = new HeaderNode();\n                node.Value = _currentToken.Value;\n                return node;\n\n            }\n\n            if (_currentToken.Type.Equals(Token.Comment))\n            {\n                var node = new CommentNode();\n                node.Value = _currentToken.Value;\n                return node;\n            }\n            {\n                var node = new NullNode();\n                return node;\n            }\n\n        }\n</pre>\n\nSo first the code to build the tree\n\n<pre>\n        private Stack<Node> _stack = new Stack<Node>();\n\n        private Node BuildTree(Node node)\n        {\n            Node root = node;\n            Node prevNode = node;\n            while (true)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(_currentToken);\n                if (_currentToken.Type.Equals(Token.EOF))\n                {\n                    return null;\n                }\n                var currentNode = Element();\n                if (currentNode.GetType() == typeof(ResultNode))\n                {\n                    Eat(_currentToken.Type);\n                    prevNode.Next = currentNode;\n                    return root;\n                }\n\n\n                if (_currentToken.Type.Equals(Token.LPAREN))\n                {\n                    _stack.Push(prevNode);\n                    prevNode.Next = currentNode;\n                    prevNode = prevNode.Next;\n                }\n\n                else if (_currentToken.Type.Equals(Token.RPAREN))\n                {\n                    prevNode.Next = currentNode;\n                    var t = _stack.Pop();\n                    t.Variations.Add(t.Next);\n                    prevNode = t;\n                    prevNode.Next = null;\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    prevNode.Next = currentNode;\n                    prevNode = prevNode.Next;\n                }\n                Eat(_currentToken.Type);\n            }\n\n\n        }\n</pre>\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n\n- Get the node type for the current token.\n- if it's a termination token return.\n- if it's not a LPAREN just eat the token and link the previous token to the current token.\n- if it's a LPAREN it means we are starting a recursive variation annotation (RVA). So push the previous node on the stack. Once we are done with the variation, we'll need to get this node back and continue the main line. Continue linking the next node to this node as if we were not in the RVA.\n- it we see a RPAREN pop the node on the stack and add the next pointer nodes to the variations list. Set the previous node to this node, and delete the next pointer for this node. \n\nSo if we walk through an example move text of \"1. e4 (11. f3 a7) 1...e5 2.Nf3\" this is node state and stack state just before the RPAREN:\n\n\n![image http://forum.dizman.org/assets/images/1-awbP4CgiRNjLcGHB.png](/img/1-awbP4CgiRNjLcGHB.png)\n\nWhen we process the RPAREN we will pop the \"e4\" node from the stack, move the next pointers nodes to the variations, delete the next pointer and set the previous node to e4 and continue processing. \n\n\n![image http://forum.dizman.org/assets/images/1-XnoB3aI53wls76dH.png](/img/1-XnoB3aI53wls76dH.png)\n\nThere the tree with embedded variations. The code I use actually takes care of further evaluating the tree into the chess model I use in the application by \nchecking if the move in the PGN is valid, and adding the comments to the move etc. But this is the basics of parsing the PGN file. \n", "file": "pgn-parser-recursive.ipynb"}, {"title": "discovering enemy units and planets", "body": "\nAt first I though that the game could be a game of perfect information where you know where all the planets are and where your enemies are based. But then first I made the planets invisible so you have to explore around to find planets to colonize. Then I though well I\u2019ll also make the enemies invisible until you scan them. The procedure is quite simple: Every ship and planet has a set property called exploredBy. When creating the units you add yourself to the set. Then during the Update() call of every ship in transit you scan the neighboring cells with a radius of N and if there is anything on that cell you add yourself to their explored list and make them visible. Setting a sight line of 1 is okay for planets but could be dangerous for enemy ships as you would end up right in the middle if you go the max distance. So setting this to 2 or 3 is going to better I guess. But this is also a tactical choice: Do you spend all your power on the engines and have nothing attack/defense when you end up in the attacking range of an enemy ship, or do you travel less but have your guard up?\n\nHere is the new stuff in action on a very small map for testing purposes\n\n![](/img/h9.gif)", "file": "discovering_enemy_units_and_planets.ipynb"}, {"title": "planets and some info panels", "body": "\nover the weekend I\u2019ve added some planets to the grid.

The info panels for the planets were GUI text at first with a canvas etc. But if you rotate these along the X-axis so that they lay flat on the grid the font rendering gets screwed up big time so I changed that to 3D text mesh. The results are pleasing.\n\n![](/img/pasip1.png)\n\nhe planet names are 3 arrays of 5 meaningless names and a unique selection is made at random from these arrays.\n\nWhile at the subject of panes I also changed the ship info pane to a text mesh.

Now it\u2019s much smoother:\n\n![](/img/pasip2.png)\n\nOne of the tricky things here was to keep the text facing towards the user as the ship rotates. The text is a child component of the ship, and is positioned 0,0,-10 relative to the ship. When the ship rotates so does the axis for the text and it would end up in different positions for each rotation of the ship. To keep it below the ship for all rotation the positioning has to be with respect to the world axis. To accomplish this I had to get the TransformPoint for the ship location with respect to the ships origin and add the difference vector. Now when you set the position of the text you get this effect. Something along the lines of\n\n```\nVector3 p = ship.asset.transform.TransformPoint (Vector3.zero);\ntext.transform.position = p + new Vector3 (0, 0, -10f);\n```\n\nHere is some video action\n\n![](/img/h7.gif)", "file": "planets_and_some_info_panels.ipynb"}, {"title": "turn processing and economy", "body": "\n2 easy parts don\u2019t require much on the 3D side, but are a pain on the GUI part.

This can be done on a direction basis. Each cell has the following the directions:\n\n1. NW (northwest)\n1. NE (northeast)\n1. E (east)\n1. SE (southeast)\n1. SW (southwest)\n1. W (west)\n\n\nWe will use an array of size 6 in each cell to store the neighbors. Each position in the array will correspond to a direction. It doesn\u2019t really matter which index is which position as long as your are consistent about it. If you use an enumeration structure you will automatically assign integers for each direction, which you can then use as the indices for the neighbors array. Keep in mid that not every cell has exactly 6 surrounding cells. Depending on the position on the board some cells may have 3 or 5 but never more than 6. Here is an example to clarify things:\n\nLet\u2019s assume the following values for the 6 directions:\n\nNW = 0, NE = 1, E = 2, SE = 3, SW = 4, W = 5\n\nAnd the Cell object will have a structure similar to `Cell[] neighbors = new Cell[6];`\n\nif the cell we are looking at has a neighbor on the NW side, then neighbors[0] \nwill point to the neighbor cell. Incidentally the neighboring cells neighbors \narray would have the original cell at the SE (3) position. So this relation \nholds:\n\nFor cells with 6 neighbors the original cell is refers to it\u2019s neighbors in a \ndirection and the neighbors refer to the original cell in the opposite direction.\n\nHow can we calculate the opposite direction? Quite easy: The position you \nwant + 3 modulo 6. The module will make the directions wrap around after \nreaching the end of the direction array.\n\nOk so let\u2019s start of with the easiest direction: the W \u2013 E connection.\n\n![](/img/hgn1.png)\n\nIn this diagram the white arrows show the W-E relationship between cells. \nRemember that we are populating the neighbor list as we create the grid, so the \nneighboring cells must exist before we can add their pointers to the neighbor \nlist. If we start from the bottom left corner, the first cell has no neighbors \nto the W, so we can skip that. On to the second cell to its right. This guy has\na neighbor to the west so we can add this to the list, and the opposite neighbor \nrelation also holds. We can do this for the rest of this row, and go on to the \nnext row. On the next row, the same is true: skip the first add the rest. So the\ncondition for creating the E/W relation can be written\n\n```\nfunction addCell(x,z,i) {\n \n if (x > 0)\n {\n  cell.neighbors[W] = cells[i - 1];\n  cells[i-1].neighbors[W + 3 % 6] = cell;\n }\n \n}\n```\n\nThe assumption here is that all the cells in the grid are stored in an array called cells. This is a 1 dimensional array. I felt that this may be a bit counter intuitive and deserved a remark. The function will be called for each X, Z coordinate with the position of the cell in the cells array.\n\nFor the SW and SE relations we need to distinguish between the cases of even and odd rows. Why? because the the first and last hex of the rows change which neighbors they have. The first element of the 2. row (index 1 so odd) has a SW and SE neighbor but the last hex is missing a SE neighbor. The first element of the 3rd row (index 2) is missing the SW neighbor. None of the cells on the first row have a SE or SW neighbor. So our conditions are:\n\n```\nif (z > 0 ) {\n if (z % 2 == 0) {\n  ...\n } else {\n  ...\n }\n}\n```\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the even case, the purple and orange arrows:\n\nThe first cell doesn\u2019t have a SW neighbor, so that\u2019s will be a special case. The rest of the cells have both neighbors.\n\n```\nif (z % 2 ==0) {\n cell.neighbors[SE] = cells[i - width]\n //add the opposite too\n if (x > 0) {\n  cell.neighbors[SW] = cells[i - width - 1] \n  //add the opposite too\n }\n}\n\n//The odd case (yellow and green arrows):\n\nif (z % 2 == 0) {\n...\n} else {\n cell.neighbors[SW] = cells[i - width]\n //add the opposite\n if (x < width - 1) {\n  cell.neighbors[SE] = cells[i-width+1]\n  //add the opposite\n }\n}\n```\n", "file": "hex_grid_neighbors.ipynb"}, {"title": "epic4x: devlog #6", "body": "\n\nPosted on March 1, 2017 by dendiz\nThe gui got some love today with the addition of a button that says \u201c+building\u201d \nthat will start the construction of a building on a surface tile.

What are those? They are a simple element of most space RTS/TBS games. They the lines that connect the stars. They are the highway lanes of space time, they enable spaceships to travel through them and guide the spaceships to their destination. They are a cheap alternative to wormhole generators which bend space time to connect stars. Here are what they look like from a popular game\n\n![](/img/wlg1.png)\n\nTechnically speaking they are edges (the lines) between vertices (stars). What we need to do is generate these edges given a set of vertices and there a couple of methods for doing this. The first one that pops up is to generate a minimum spanning tree. But a minimum spanning tree would look this\n\n![](/img/wlg2.png)\n\nand this doesn\u2019t exactly look like a nice interstellar highway as we would like to be able to travel to a couple of nearby stars from our origin star. This way when we are trying to reach a distant star we have multiple options of getting to that star. Image that you did your warplanes using an MST and you want to get from star A to star D and the only path is A -> B -> C -> D. What do you do if there is an enemy fleet in the star C system and you don\u2019t want to engage that fleet with your science ship? Observe that the MST has only 1 connection between 2 neighboring stars so there is no way for you to do that.\n\nSo here is a naive algorithm I came up with\n\n1. let S be a list star with random coordinates in a 1000\u00d71000 plane\n1. for each star in S\n    1. if a star was visited before, skip it\n    1. get the N closest stars to this star\n    1. add a connection from this star to its neighbors\n    1. add a connection from each neighbor to this star the get closest star also needs some attention as we don\u2019t want to return a close neighbor if it already has a connection to the current star.\n\nthe get closest star also needs some attention as we don\u2019t want to return a close neighbor if it already has a connection to the current star.\n\n1. filter out all other stars except our current star\n1. filter out all stars that already have a connection with the current star\n1. map the remaining stars as a tuple of ( distance to source, this star)\n1. sort by the distance\n1. take N closest and return the stars from the tuple\n\n\nThe N parameter determines the number of max connections going out from a star. Here is an image of this algorithm with N=5\n\n\n![](/img/wlg3.png)\n\n\nThis does look a bit better but there are too many cramped points where it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going on. The stars are too close to each other so we need some kind of regulation when generating the random points for the stars. One way of doing this is checking the \u201cstar density\u201d when generating the star and only placing the star if it\u2019s acceptable. This basically means not placing a star to close another and we can do this by checking if the generated star falls within a range of existing stars. That would be done by checking if it lies in a circle of radius R with the star at its origin.\n\n1. let S be a list of stars initially empty\n1. while S size < number of stars to generate\n1. generate a random point in the plane\n1. if this point satisfies the density condition add the star to S\n\n\nOne point to note about this algorithm is that it has the possibility of never terminating if the density conditions are too strict and it cannot find a good place for the next star. So it\u2019s a good idea to add a loop counter check that will terminate with an exception after a number of tries and tell the user to relax the number of stars and the radius R. The acceptable density function can be done as follows\n\n\n1. let R be the minimum distance that two stars should be apart (which is the radius R)\n1. for each star already generated check if (src.x \u2013 star.x)^2 \u2013 (src.y \u2013 star.y)^2 < R^2\n1. if there are stars that satisfy this equation then the density condition is not satisfied.\n\n\nAfter adding the density check and reducing N to 3 the lines look a bit clearer.\n\n![](/img/wlg4.png)\n\n\nThere is a fundamental error in this approach. If you select a low N (connectivity value) then you sometimes will get disconnected stars like this\n\n![](/img/wlg5.png)\n\n\nTo address this issue a combination of an MST and the naive approach could work.\n\n![](/img/wlg6.png)\n\n\nNow that the MST guarantees that all the graph will be connected we have addressed the issue but still, the layout doesn\u2019t look good for efficient traveling. We still could use more triangulation that is more lanes connecting nearby stars. Using the closest N method led to a cluttered layout. The cause of this clutter is that if 2 stars are almost in a straight line and are the 2 closest stars, there will 2 connections to these stars that overlap.\n\n![](/img/wlg7.png)\n\n\nYet another way of connecting the stars would be to use Delaunay Triangulation. This also produces a very nice warplane structure but still, has the cluttering problem due to the star layout.\n\n![](/img/wlg8.png)\n\nNow let\u2019s address the clutter problem. It seems that the warplanes look cluttered if there are neighboring stars too close to an existing warplane.\n\n![](/img/wlg9.png)\n\n\nthe green arrow shows a lane we could do better without. How can we detect these lanes? Just from the definition of the problem. If a neighbor star is too close to a lane, drop the existing lane so the closer lane to the a star will remain. Here is a simple outline for the algorithm that requires a bit of linear algebra:\n\n1. Sort all the neighbors for each star is descending order according to their distance from the origin star.\n1. for each neighbor i to all neighbors \u2013 1\n    1. for each neighbor j from i + 1 to all neighbors\n    1. if the distance of neighbor i from the lane between origin star and neighbor j < some threshold T discard the lane calculating the distance of a point P0 to a line given by P1 and P2 is\n\n`Math.abs( (y2-y1)x0 \u2013 (x2-x1)y0 + x2y1 \u2013 y2x1 ) / Math.sqrt( Math.pow(y2-y1,2) + Math.pow(x2-x1,2) )`\n\nHere is the result of a relaxed threshold that will draw a lot of lines\n\n![](/img/wlg10.png)\n\nhere are the same results with a stricter threshold that has discarded the middle lane\n\n![](/img/wlg10.png)\n\n", "file": "warp_lane_generation_with_delaunay_triangulation.ipynb"}, {"title": "nextcloud installation with docker + full text search", "body": "\nThere are multiple options when installing nextcloud but I always install my self hosted services through docker just to keep everything isolated and easy to backup.

Because the search capability for nextcloud out of the box is pretty naive in that it only searches for the query in the file name, which is OK sometimes, but most of the time you need the search to be in the contents of the file. This capability is provided by an external search server, in this case via ElasticSearch (which is an excellent search server albeit resource hungry). Ok, so here is the docker-compose file I use to setup everything:\n\n```\nversion: '2'\n\nservices:\n  db:\n    image: mariadb\n    command: --transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED --binlog-format=ROW\n    restart: always\n    volumes:\n      - ./db:/var/lib/mysql\n    environment:\n      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=\n      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=\n      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud\n      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud\n\n  app:\n    image: nextcloud\n    ports:\n      - 90:80\n    links:\n      - db\n      - es\n    volumes:\n      - ./nextcloud:/var/www/html\n    restart: always\n\n  cron:\n    image: nextcloud\n    links:\n     - db\n     - es\n    volumes:\n      - ./nextcloud:/var/www/html\n      - ./crontab:/var/spool/cron/crontabs/www-data\n    restart: always\n  \n  es:\n    build: ./elastic-docker/.\n    environment:\n      - discovery.type=single-node\n    volumes:\n      - ./elastic:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data\n```\n\nThe first two services are from the standard docker-compose file in the nextcloud documentation page. I've added another service that runs the cron scripts (you can delete this is you have a different way to run crons) and then there is elastic search service. I use local directories for persistent storage as it's super easy for backups. The elastic search image requires a bit of customization so here is the `Dockerfile` for the service\n\n```\nFROM docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.6.2\nRUN /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install --batch ingest-attachment\n```\n\nElastic search wants a plugin to index content from nextcloud. \n\nAfter these files are in place, spin up the stack with `docker-compose up -d`.

You can ignore the warnings from the ElasticSearch image. \n\nAfter the containers are up install the following apps for Nextcloud\n\n- full text search \n- full text search - elastic platform\n- full text search - files\n\nNow you can test the installation using\n\n```\ndocker-compose exec --user www-data app php occ fulltextsearch:test\n```\n\nif everything goes well you can start the indexing\n\n```\ndocker-compose exec --user www-data app php occ fulltextsearch:index\n```", "file": "nextcloud-elastic.ipynb"}, {"title": "procedural dungeon generation", "body": "\nThe basics of any roguelike dungeon crawling game is the dungeon.

The happiness may increase depending \non circumstance but it will never exceed the habitability multiplier of the \nplanet.\n\n\nIn other news, I started working on ship and fleet management. I need a good \nship command system design that is flexible as there are many command with \ndifferent parameters. I\u2019m thinking of linking the components on a ship with \ncommands that make sense for that component, e.g an engine component is linked \nto a move command that takes from planet and to planet as parameters. \nI need to come up with a good interface for supporting different types of \nparameters though, like an FTL command would take stars as parameters and \nnot planets. An attack command may take a target ship etc. There are also some \n\u201cmeta-command\u201d like survey system would actually create N sub-commands of move \nto planet X then survey planet X then move to planey Y\u2026 you get the idea. \nAlso maybe a counter on these commands would be required that is pre-calculated\nand has the duration of this command. If surveying a planet takes 5 turn, then\nthat command will be on the top of the command queue for 5 turns then the next \ncommand will start processing. Maybe a looping of a commad series could be \nuseful too, for example if you wish to patrol between a few star system you \ncould create a command queue like FTL to system A, FTL to B, FTL to C and start \nover. I recall Aurora 4x had a similar command interface. \n\nWhile thinking about  this stuff I realized that the ships had an engine component which was for \ntravelling between planets, but planets didn\u2019t have coordinates therefore the \ndistance between them is not known.

So how would you do that, be also allowing multiple ships to move at any given time without running into each other? The first iteration of the path finder was the rasterized path finder I explained here. This method will provide a list of cells that the ship must travel through (I since have added a new algorithm that takes into account any obstacles in the way. It just returns a different list of cells which isn\u2019t of any significance for the navigation command system). When the user clicks on a ship, we need to store that clicked cell and it\u2019s ship into a temporary variable. The first click will also highlight the possible cells the ship can navigate to. The post about cells in range explains how there are calculated. The second time the user clicks on a cells, it can mean 3 things\n\n1. the user wants to navigate to a cell\n1. the user wants to cancel the selection\n1. the user wants to select another ship from his fleet\n1. the user wants to attack an enemy ship\n\nWe will address the first 3 items. Items 2 and 3 are simple so let\u2019s get them out of the way first. If the user wants to cancel the selection, he just clicks on a cell not highlighted by the cells in range call. We just need to check if the clicked cell is in the list returned from this call. If not reset the variable that holds the clicked ship to return to the initial state. If the user wants to select another ship to move, if has clicked on a cell with one of his ships. Since he can\u2019t attack that ship, just check if the clicked cell has a ship on it and if that ship belongs to the player. If true, set the selected cell to that one.\n\nHere is an image of a state machine that shows to transitions and states\n\n![](/img/nop.jpg)\n\nThe red transition is cancelling the selection, and the green transition is selecting another ship to navigate.\n\nNow let\u2019s explore the case where the user wants to navigate to a cell. We need \nto support multiple ships wandering around at the same time, so the user doesn\u2019t\nhave to wait for the first ship to arrive before issuing a second order.\nThis means we need a queue of navigation orders that will be processed at each\nupdate. We create an object that will store the source cell, target cell, the\npath the ship will take and the ship model and the ship object that carries meta\ndata associated with the ship. At each update call we will process each item in \nthe command queue and make the required movement to the next cell in the path. \nAfter each item in the queue is processed it gets queued again. This way all the \nships movements will be updated once for every update call. If there is another \nship in the next cell for the ship we are processing just skip that command item \nfor this frame. This will make the current ship wait if there is another ship \nblocking the path, until the ship moves away from that cell. There is an edge \ncase that needs to handled here, which is that if the blocking ships final cell\nis that cell, then the current ship will wait forever. To mitigate this case \nchecking if any ships will end up at a cell blocking the way needs to be \nconsidered when creating the command.

Say I want to add the numbers from 1 to 100. (yes I know there is a formula for this). If each addition takes 1 unit of time, I could do this task on my own in a 100 units. But If I call 2 friends over and say\n\n* Friend A: add the numbers from 1 to 50 and tell me the result.\n* Friend B: add the numbers from 51 to 100 and tell me the result.\n\nSince the 2 operations are mutually exclusive my friends could do this in parallel and tell me the results. Then I would just need to add the 2 results to get my answer. That would take `50 + 2` units of time, almost twice as faster as doing it on my own. If I have 4 friends it would take me `25 + 4 = 29` time units. But if I called over 100 friends each one would give me back to number I gave them and I would have to add 100 numbers after the map operation to reduce the result. So there is an optimal point for the number of mappers to take. This point is the square root of the number of operations. Although I would guess the optimal solution formula is intuitive to most people, it can be shown with simple calculus. If you write the number of steps required as the function of the number of parallel operations, and take the 1st derivative and find the solution for zero, this will be the optimal point.\n\nThe function can be written like this:\nfor a number of operations X I need N people doing parallel work. After that I will need N steps to get to the final result.\nThis is can be written as\n\n`f(n) = X/n + n`\n\nlets take the 1st derivative\n\n`f(x) = X*n^-1 + n`\n\n`f'(x) = -X*n^2 + C`\n\nif we say that this is equal to 0, then we can see that the equation is a quadratic equation with the optimal value being the square root of some value.\n\nThis was just a random thought that popped up in my head today. \n", "file": "map-reduce.ipynb"}, {"title": "planet colonization", "body": "\nThis one wasn\u2019t tricky as I expected it to be.

Here is an example:\n\n\"add bananas oranges and lemons to my list\"\n\non the current (12) version of iOS this will result in a single item with the content \"bananas oranges and lemons\" to be added. This is pretty annoying. If we assume we have some magical NLP that figures out the content it should not be that hard to figure out there are multiple items to be added to the list in this utterance. Here is very simple way of achieving this:\n\n1. assume we have a dicitionary of all the words/items without stop words.\n2. create all N-grams of the input string, starting with the number of words in the sentence for the N in the first N-gram\n3. search the dictionary for the words in the N-gram list, if found add it to the result list and remove from input string.\n4. decrease the number N and repeat the search until N = 0\n\nFor the example above let's say our dictionary is:\n\n```\nbananas\nbanana\noranges\norange\nlemons\nlemon\n```\n\nOur first n-gram will be\n\n`[\"bananas oranges and lemons\"]`\n\nThis is not in the dictionary so nothing to do.\n\n\n`[\"bananas oranges and\" , \"oranges and lemons\"]`\n\nNothing from this list in the dictionary so continue.\n\n`[\"bananas oranges\", \"oranges and\", \"and lemons\"]`\n\n...\n\n`[\"bananas\", \"oranges\", \"and\", \"lemons\"]`\n\n3 of the items in the list our in our dictionary so we can add them as items in our result list.\n\nHow is this different from just splitting based on a space character? Well there are some words like \"orange juice\" that have to be a single item in the result list. If we did have this in the input sentence then we would have detected it in the 2-gram phase\nand added it to the result list.\n\n**Some implementation optimization thoughts**\n\nFirst thing is that when creating the N-grams we are using a sliding window of decreasing lengths. So instead of creating the N-grams for each index from scratch each time, adding the next word to the window and removing the first will yield a linear time algorithm for constructing the list.\n\n\nSecond thing is that there is no need to keep the whole dictionary in memory.

Otherwise we create a new group and add it into that group.\n\n```\nCollections.sort(data);\n\n        SuperList<SuperList<Double>> groups = new SuperList<>();\n        groups.add(new SuperList<>());\n        groups.get(0).add(data.get(0));\n        for (int i = 1; i < data.size(); i++) {\n            SuperList<Double> group = groups.getLast();\n            Double x = data.get(i);\n            if (Math.abs(x - group.get(0)) < epsilon) {\n                group.add(x);\n            } else {\n                SuperList<Double> newList = new SuperList<>();\n                newList.add(x);\n                groups.add(newList);\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nI finally had the chance to plot the results of this, so I updated the post:\n\n![](/img/ecosrz2.png)\n\nThe red zones are the resistance which is all tuples with price above the last \nclose price and the green zones are the support zones.\n", "file": "efficient_calculation_of_support_resistance_zones.ipynb"}, {"title": "spring boot multi module with gradle", "body": "\nGradle is a build tool in the java world that will one day hopefully deprecate maven.

There are also the \"lucky\" kind of people that despite doing the same thing year after year either are not bored or are bored but don't mind the boredom. If there are really not bored, which I find incomprehensible - that's fine. If they are bored but don't have the will power to change it then there is not much I could recommend. But there are also the kind that want to change but don't know how it's possible. I probably would fall into this category. At it's core what you do as a software engineer is read/write and process data. One way or another be it be database manipulations, video/image manipulations or something else. Different domains require different optimizations on the way of manipulating the data. For example some could require efficient usage of memory, others may require fault tolerance or speed. And for most of the people out there nobody is inventing a new wheel. We are just implementing already defined solutions to our problem. This can get boring extremely fast. Although I do not have any experience as a professional in other disciplines, I believe it's not wrong to interpolate that the same goes for jobs. It's the same rinse and repeat cycle day after day and for people with creative minds this can be a torturing experience. This is one of the main reasons I believe that the turn-over rate in the IT industry is above average (http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/career-management/tech-companies-have-highest-turnover-rate/). So what can be done to make your job challenging and fun? What drives those who are creative but yet still manage to do amazing stuff without getting bored? Those who everybody looks at with envy and wishes they had that job? What I came to realize is that the kind of people that consistently seek new challenges will satisfy this by either letting go of the current position, or by progressing in a different area. This doesn't mean that you have solved or out grown the task at hand, it just means that you are no longer satisfied in general with doing the similar stuff day after day. An example would be for a database programmer to explore the field of 3D graphics and games. There are new unexplored problems in that domain that you can relate to and solving these problems or researching them broadens your perspective. The moment you can adapt the methods used in that field to your field of expertise you've hit the jackpot. This can be a moment of a truly unique discovery or invention or just a satisfying \"aha\" moment. But whatever it is it will make your brain flood with endorphins and make you feel good. A lot of inventions ranging from machinery to algorithms were made by mimicking nature! A completely unrelated field to both computer science and engineering in general. It is highly likely that some guy who was a keen observer and a creative type and possibly had an ant farm one day had a lightning bolt idea of mimicking the techniques used by ants to optimize their food search and adapting these techniques to calculate optima in general CS problems - Ant swarm optimization was born. Yngwie Malmsteen is a great electric guitar virtuoso but if he is the type of guy I'm talking about I bet he would be bored sick with all his songs and albums, because they basically very similar. On the other hand Pink Floyd who is infamous for experimenting with drugs brings a whole new experience to their music. They are incorporating different aspects from different experiences into their music not to get boring. The 1970s version of top gear was just like any other car show. That's why it was boring and eventually went off-air. The new version of top gear has so many different themes in it ranging from comedy to challenges to other ridiculous stuff but that's what made the show a huge success and interesting.

I'm going to assume that you have spring mvc and freemarker already configured and running, if you don't there are plenty of resources showing how to do that so just go ahead and use them, there is no need to repeat that stuff here.

The basic approach is\n\n1. create an interceptor\n2. check the method that will be executed for this request in the interceptor\n3. if the method has an annotation check login state for the request.\n\nI'll be demonstrating this concept for an API that does authentication using a parameter called \u201ctoken\u201d but it can be simply adapted to session based authentication mechanisms.\nFirst of all you\u2019ll need the interceptor, create a class called AuthenticationInterceptor and extend the spring HandlerInterceptorAdapter class.

If it is not present than this action does not require any login checks so proceed with any other handlers in the chain. If there is an annotation ask the authenticationService to do some checks.

The grails application depends on a few artifacts from the java project. Grails does have maven support, but you will run into all sorts of classpath problems when you try to integrate with a multi-module complicated parent project. So the solution was to execute the grails build after the parent project was done. The problem is that the parent project artifacts were not being published to a maven repository and the grails app needs to find the artifacts in the local repository before it can do anything. For a multi-module maven project, it is not a problem for the individual modules as they recognize each other as dependencies but the grails project is not a module of this parent project. So the initial solution was to create a pom for the grails project with the exec-maven-plugin running grailsw test-app -unit after the install phase. The relevant pom part looks like this\n\n```xml\n<plugin>\n    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>\n    <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n    <version>1.2.1</version>\n    <executions>\n        <execution>\n            <phase>install</phase>\n            <goals>\n                <goal>exec</goal>\n            </goals>\n        </execution>\n    </executions>\n    <configuration>\n        <executable>./build.sh</executable>\n        <workingDirectory>.</workingDirectory>\n        <skip>false</skip>\n        <arguments>\n            <argument>-e</argument>\n        </arguments>\n    </configuration>\n</plugin>\n```\n\nAdd this to the parent pom as a module, and you are set to go, except that you are not. If the builds run sequentially all is fine, because the dependencies all get installed and the grails app is the last module to run and grails can locate the artifacts in the local repository. But this is a relatively large code base and running parallel builds really cuts down the build time. The trick to solve this problem is to go back to the roots of maven: Maven is a dependency management application, and it will make sure that if a build depends on A, A will be present to continue. So adding the artifacts as dependencies to the pom makes sure that they are present in the local repository even when doing parallel builds. Using this you can actually serialize a parallel build, making sure that the required artifacts for a module that is not built with maven are present. The downside is that you have to add the dependencies to both `BuildConfig.groovy` and the `pom.xml`", "file": "maven_parallel_build_order.ipynb"}, {"title": "jspipe", "body": "\n\n# Quick Intro\n\nPIPE is a small javascript framework for building ajax enabled application using a declarative syntax and minimal amount of javascript code. It works by splitting the application pages into fragments that have attributes that define the view model and behavior of the fragment. Installation is very easy, just include pipe.js in your HTML and the dependencies underscore.js and jquery and you are good to go. PIPE will run automatically after the document is loaded and work its magic.\n\n\n# Details\n\n![](http://deniz.dizman.org/img/pipejs-fragment.png)\n\nThe diagram above shows components of a list application. We can divide this application into the following parts\n\n* A collection of lists, that show which lists the user has created.\n* The items in the selected list.\n* The details of the item selected.\n* Comments on the selected item.\n\nEach of these components load a different view, have different behaviors, and refresh them selves on certain events. For example the comment component should refresh its self after the user has posted a comment, but the list collection need not refresh its self. This is what ajax applications are all about, just refreshing the required parts of the page, and leaving the rest alone, therefore providing a faster and smoother user experience. These components are called \"fragments\" in PIPE terminology. PIPE provides a framework of managing the lifecycles of these fragments, by loading and unloading them or refreshing them whenever there are data changes. It does so by making the user write only a minimal amount of javascript. The user can declare the behavir of the fragment by assigning special attributes in the markup. \n\nLet's take a closer look on these fragments (the following examples are all available on the example application on github):\n\n```\n    <div class=\"span3\">\n        <div id=\"listbox\" fragment-url=\"/partial/listbox\" watch=\"/lists/add\"></div>\n        ...\n    </div>\n```\n\nThis is the code for the listbox - the collection of the lists - from the file `home.html.php` which is the users home screen after login. The `div` is the container for the fragment. Let's check out the attributes:\n\n# fragment-url\n\nThis attribute defines the URL that PIPE will request to inject into the container. When the page is loaded PIPE will scan all the `div`s in the markup and find the fragment containers. Then an ajax GET request will be sent to these fragment URL in parallel. If a fragment is dependent on another fragment, you should embed the dependent fragment into the other fragments markup. PIPE will resolve the dependencies and load them in serial mode. \n\n# watch\n\nThis attribute defines a watcher URL which is used to notify the fragment that data has been updated and that it should load its self. PIPE will scan all fragments and register any watch URLs that a fragment contains. The URL is a regular expression so multiple URLs or wild card URLs may be defined using the javascript regular expression syntax. After an ajax request to the watch URL is completed, PIPE will refresh all the fragments with this watch URL, which means a request will be made to the fragment-url and the result will be injected into the container.\n\n# Params\n\nThis attribute defines any extra parameters that need to be sent to the fragment url as GET parameters. This enables interaction between fragments. For example in the lists application, when a user selects a list in the list box, the list item display fragment must be aware of which list to load. This can be done by passing parameters to the fragment url indicating which list to load. This attribute can also be manipulated using the javascript API of PIPE with the methods:\n\n* PIPE.addParam\n* PIPE.removeParam\n* PIPE.setParams\n* PIPE.getParams\n\nThe attribute is stored as a query string, although the javascript API manipulates it as a JSON object.\n\n# Disabled\n\nIf this attribute is set to \"disabled\" PIPE will skip loading this fragment. This is usefull for just placing the container in the markup for future use. The example application uses this to show the details of the selected item. Until an item is selected from the list, it doesn't make sense to have the details item fragment loaded.\n\n\n# Unload\n\nThis attribute is used to empty the content of the fragment container on certain requests. This attribute acts exactly the same as the watch attribute, except that instead of refreshing the fragment, it will empty it. The example application uses this to empty the item details fragment, when an item is deleted. \n\n\n# Routes\n\nPIPE also provides a javascript API under the PIPE namespace. PIPE can act as a router for binding functions to the location hash. This is a very simple way of adding behaviour to your elements. The syntax is very simple and can be seen in the `lists.js` file.\n\n```\n    PIPE.register(\"#!/list/:id/filter/:filter\", function(id,filter) {\n        ....\n    });\n```\n\nThe `:id` and `:filter` are named parameters, meaning that any portion that matches the pattern will be given to the function as an argument. When the location hash matches this filter, the function gets executed. For example the URL\n\n```\n    http://localhost/home/#!/lists/6/filter/incomplete\n```\n\nwill execute the function with the parameters 6 and \"incomplete\" respectively. \n\n\n# PIPE.load\n\nAfter certain user actions, you may need to reload a fragment with adjusted parameters. Using the PIPE parameter manipulation functions and PIPE.load this is possible. An example is displaying the item details. The registered function for the item display URL gets the list id, and item id from the named parameters and reloads the item detail fragment using the javascript API. Multiple requests made to the same fragment are queued and only the newest content will be injected into the container\n\n[API reference]: /projects/pipe-api/api.html\n", "file": "jspipe.ipynb"}, {"title": "jschess", "body": "\n\nJSchess is a simple chess game coded with javascript against a moderate AI opponent (around 1200 ELO) that runs in the browser.\n\n![img](http://deniz.dizman.org/img/jschess.png)\n\n\nSource: https://github.com/dendiz/JSChess\n\n", "file": "jschess.ipynb"}, {"title": "e-commerce sdlc", "body": "\nWorking in a different industry that has different demands, and brings different challenges to the table, is a thrilling experience. During my time in the development process for end-user applications and telecom applications never have I seen the chaos and change rate and pace that I have seen in the aggressive e-commerce industry. Using processes and methods that you are accustomed to from other industries just does not cut it here. Managing development for an e-commerce site is like funneling chaos through a pin hole. Committing to issues/tasks on a (bi)weekly basis is a dream in this ever so fast transforming universe. So you have to devise a new method of making the production line run. So here is exactly what is not working:\n\n* Choose N number of issues, and try to get them developed by time X\n* Get them tested.\n* Fix reopened stuff.\n* Get the reopens tested\n* deploy live\n\n\nThe bad thing about the first step is that, by the time you are half way through the N chosen issues, something new with a higher priority than everything else pops up, that must be done now. It is almost impossible to eliminate this interference without loosing competitive edge.\n\nThe bad thing about the second item is that the QA team is working constantly in burst loads. One minute they don\u2019t have anything related to the release, the next minute they are expected to test N issues in a short time.\n\nThe bad thing about the 3rd item is that QA is idle again waiting for a new release with the fixes.This can be mitigated by opting to continue the tests even if a bug is found, and sending all fixed reopened items to test later. This is trading off robustness for speed, as ideally the test would stop, the bug would be fixed, and the tests would start from the beginning, in case that bug has caused any side effects.\n\nThe 4th item can also be avoided by not submitting reopened items at all (except for really crucial issues), and waiting for the next release to deploy them.\n\nSo this usual way of developing is not suited for such a fast changing environment. Here is the alternative method we are experimenting with\n\n* every task is assign a priority during creating\n* every body picks the next most important task from the pool\n* every hour the release manager integrates any finished task to the development branch, from the topic branch of that issue\n* the QA team constantly tests the issues that are integrated into the development branch\n* if there is a reopen it sent back to the developer every six hours the release manager selects all the issues that have passed testing in the development branch and integrates them into the release branch\n* QA runs an integration test on the release branch\n* if there is a task breaking integration, it is unmerged\n* deployment is done every day\n\n\nI think the major advantages of this type of development cycle is that the future-reopen issues aren\u2019t loosing time waiting to be included in a release but are tested on the spot, and are never merged into a release. Also another great advantage is that the load distribution on the QA team is evened out. I will publish some empirical data on both processes once I have collected enough for the second process type.\n\nHaving a test server that is independent of cocky sys-admins is crucial to the success of this methodology. You absolutely need a smaller version of your live environment at your finger tips, that you can break restore at will.\n\nA further improvement will be added by actually being able to test each issue in isolation in it\u2019s own branch. This brings the problem of having to cope with DB changes (since each branch\u2019s deployed code will be using the same DB) that may lead to conflict.\n", "file": "e-commerce-sdlc.ipynb"}, {"title": "tactics chess", "body": "\nTactics training is such an essential part of chess if you want to improve. So much so that I bought a premium chess.com subscription mainly for the unlimited tactics they give. But then I thought, why not do my own and have unlimited tactics to practice on? See that cluster from laptops a couple of posts ago? well that is the chess engine cluster that I\u2019m using to generate tactics training puzzles such as this:\n\n![](/img/tactix1.png)\n\nwhite to play and get a good position with blacks king wondering around the board \ud83d\ude00\n\nSo how are tactics like these generated? Find the positions for tactical opportunities is actually rather simple. You get some game PGN\u2019s, and feed them into a chess engine like stockfish, and mark the position where the engine evaluation goes from a draw-ish position to a material advantage for one side. For example consider the board state\n\n`r1b1r3/1p1nqpkp/p3pnp1/3p2N1/3P3Q/2NBP3/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 b - - 13 15`\n\nthe evaluation stock fish has given for this position is 34cp (0.34 pawns). But in the game black made the mistake of playing e5 which tilted the evaluation of the position to 338cp (3.38 pawns) in whites favour. This means that white has the opportunity to gain a substantial advantage with a certain move. That\u2019s what\u2019s asked of the player during the tactics training session, find this move and the sequence of moves that come after it to hold the advantage. And that\u2019s the hard part. How do you know when to terminate the sequence of moves for the puzzle. If you just let the player play 1 move, you have no way of knowing if the player actually saw the correct sequence that leads to an advantageous position or if it was just a lucky guess. It\u2019s not satisfying to the player just to play one move and not follow through.\n\nThe chess engine evaluation line actually gives you the lines that it considers good, so that\u2019s a big help. You just need to have the player play along these lines, but for how many moves? A tactical position may result in an advantage in 2 moves or 5 moves after a long combination. What I have found that works nicely are the following conditions for termination:\n\n* Go a maximum of 6 moves (12 plies) deep during searching. 6 moves deep is very challenging even for masters of the game.\n* if the last move was not a capture\n* if the last move was not a check\n* if the last move was not a mate in X move\n* if the opponent would pass, a capture would not be made\n\nChecking for these conditions after every candidate move leads to some pretty decent puzzles.\n\nHere is my poor-mans cluster that crunched all the games to generate the tactics\n\n![](http://imgur.com/ZEySaMS.png)\n\n\nArchitecture\nThe tactix application consists of 3 main parts\n\n1. domain models\n2. tactix finder\n3. tactix webapp\n\nThe most interesting part is the tactix-finder module that actually implements most of what I was talking above.

So when using the apache spark reduce you have to pay attention that the reducing function is commutative and also associative.

The learning curve is really flat, and you\u2019ll get to crunching data in no time. I have already implemented a batch log processing / analytics application and a real-time streaming application at work for n11 and I thought that I do another fun project with spark. This time it\u2019s generating a heat-map of a chess board by processing chess games. A heat map of a chess board is 8\u00d78 table with each cell representing a square of the chess board with a color. Blue means there were not many moves to that square, and red means there were a lot. It\u2019s an analogy to the warm-cold method of defining distance. We will do this for each piece there is in chess. The end results will look something like this\n\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/6hGU74G.png)\n\nSo, a method we could use and that I\u2019ve tried was to generate a FEN representation of the board after each move, and feed this data to apache spark to extract how much each piece occupied each square. This did sound reasonable and it would have been very efficient because spark would not need any chess knowledge to compute the heat map. Just some string parsing would suffice. But it turns out that this method of processing overwhelms the heat map with the initial positions of the piece. Why? because the pieces rest on their initial squares for quite some time before they move. Let\u2019s look at an example to make it clearer. The initial state of the board as a FEN string is:\n\n`rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR`\n\nthis would mean add 1 to the squares for each piece. E.g the rooks are on a1, a8, h1, h8. Add 1 to each square. After the first move, say 1. e4, the FEN is\n\n`rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR`\n\nThe pawn will register a hit for the e4 square, but so will all the other remaining pieces for their home squares! The will generate a heat map that says all the pieces like their home squares best which isn\u2019t really helpful.\n\nSo we need another approach. The best way is to register a square that a piece has moved to. This requires parsing the moves in the PGN game and actually playing through the game. So we need a chess parsing library to use in our spark job. Fortunately I had a nifty little port of chess.js for java handy here that would allow me to play through the games and get back the squares the pieces moved to. But before we can dive into this, we need to clean the PGN files and make them suitable for processing by Spark. Data processing platforms like spark like to munch data that are in CSV format \u2013 a line of values separated by a comma. The values in our file will be the moves from each game, starting from the initial position.

So let\u2019s start by parsing the PGN files using chesspresso\n\n\n```\ndef getGames(file: File) : Stream[Game] = {\n    val fis = new FileInputStream(file)\n    println(\"parsing file \" + file)\n    val reader = new PGNReader(fis, \"\")\n \n    val games = di2(reader)\n    //println(file + \"... found \" + games.size + \" games\")\n \n    games\n  }\n\n```\n\n\nthis method expects the PGN file as a File object, and reads it using the chesspresso PGNReader.\n\n\n```\ndef di2(reader:PGNReader): Stream[Game] = {\n    @tailrec\n    def di3(game:Game, reader:PGNReader, gameList : Stream[Game]): Stream[Game] = {\n      if (Option(game).isDefined) {\n        if (gameList.size % 5000 == 0) {\n          println(\"processing game \" +gameList.size + \" \" + game)\n        }\n        //println(\"found game \" + game + \" list size \" +gameList.size )\n        di3(try {reader.parseGame()} catch{ case e:Exception=&gt;reader.parseGame()},reader, game #:: gameList)\n      } else {\n        gameList\n      }\n    }\n    di3(reader.parseGame(), reader, Stream.empty)\n  }\n\n```\n\n\nthis is the actual method that reads the games to a list. Chesspresso iterates over the games and streams the games from the file on demand (because PGN files may contain more than one game). Since we are consuming the whole stream this will not work if you try to process a PGN file with lots of games in it (around 1M suffers on my 8gb machine). If you need to split a PGN file to smaller files use pgn-extract.\n\n\n```\n def extractMoves(game:Game) : String = {\n    game.gotoStart()\n    try {\n      val mainLine = game.getMainLine.toSeq\n      val moves = mainLine.map(x=> {\n        game.getPosition.doMove(x)\n        x\n      }).toList.filter(_ != &quot;&quot;)\n      moves.mkString(&quot;,&quot;)\n    } catch {\n      case e:Exception=>\"\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThis method will get the moves made in the game as a list and concatenate them using a comma to the CSV format that I showed you above. Chesspresso will throw an exception on an invalid move, and some PGN\u2019s do contain invalid moves.\n\n\n```\n def main(args:Array[String]) = {\n    val hotFolder = \"/data/pgn/archive/\"\n    val outFolder = \"/data/fen/\"\n    val files: Seq[File] = new File(hotFolder).listFiles().toSeq.filter(_.getName.endsWith(\"pgn\"))\n \n    files.foreach({file=>\n      val games = getGames(file)\n      val moves = games.map(extractMoves)\n      val target = new BufferedOutputStream( new FileOutputStream(new File(outFolder+file.getName + \".moves\")) )\n      try moves.foreach({x=> target.write(x.getBytes); target.write(\"n\".getBytes) }) finally target.close\n    })\n  }\n\n```\n\nAll that\u2019s left is to execute the parsing methods and save the CSV move list to a file and we are ready to jump into spark to process this data. Thats what the main function above does.\n\nSo let\u2019s define some spark configs like the CSV file location etc.\n\n```\nval logFile = \"/data/fen/\" // Should be some file on your system\nval outputDir = \"/tmp/\"\nval conf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"Simple Application\")\nval sc = new SparkContext(conf)\nval moveData = sc.textFile(logFile)\n```\n\n\nwe will also need a data structure to hold the results, how many times each piece moves to a square.\n\n```\n val map = Map(\n        \"r\" -> Array.fill(64)(0),\n        \"n\" -> Array.fill(64)(0),\n        \"b\" -> Array.fill(64)(0),\n        \"k\" -> Array.fill(64)(0),\n        \"q\" -> Array.fill(64)(0),\n        \"p\" -> Array.fill(64)(0)\n      )\n```\n\n\nthis map can be though of like this: the keys represent each piece (the colors are irrelevant) and the values are an array of size 64 \u2013 one slot for each square on the chess board. When a piece moves to a square we will increment the count in the array.\n\n\n```\n  val mmap = Map(\n        \"a8\"->0, \"b8\"->1, \"c8\"->2, \"d8\"->3, \"e8\"->4, \"f8\"->5, \"g8\"->6, \"h8\"->7,\n        \"a7\"->8, \"b7\"->9, \"c7\"->10,\"d7\"->11,\"e7\"->12,\"f7\"->13,\"g7\"->14,\"h7\"->15,\n        \"a6\"->16,\"b6\"->17,\"c6\"->18,\"d6\"->19,\"e6\"->20,\"f6\"->21,\"g6\"->22,\"h6\"->23,\n        \"a5\"->24,\"b5\"->25,\"c5\"->26,\"d5\"->27,\"e5\"->28,\"f5\"->29,\"g5\"->30,\"h5\"->31,\n        \"a4\"->32,\"b4\"->33,\"c4\"->34,\"d4\"->35,\"e4\"->36,\"f4\"->37,\"g4\"->38,\"h4\"->39,\n        \"a3\"->40,\"b3\"->41,\"c3\"->42,\"d3\"->43,\"e3\"->44,\"f3\"->45,\"g3\"->46,\"h3\"->47,\n        \"a2\"->48,\"b2\"->49,\"c2\"->50,\"d2\"->51,\"e2\"->52,\"f2\"->53,\"g2\"->54,\"h2\"->55,\n        \"a1\"->56,\"b1\"->57,\"c1\"->58,\"d1\"->59,\"e1\"->60,\"f1\"->61,\"g1\"->62,\"h1\"->63\n      )\n\n```\n\nthis second mmap array is a mapping from the string (SAN) notation of a square to it\u2019s place the array that I mentioned above. We will need this because chesslib\u2019s internal representation of a chess board as an array is different than what we will be using. Now let\u2019s get to crunching those chess moves:\n\n```\n\n val key = moveData.flatMap(line=> {\n      // the maps above are here - omitted for readability\n      val cl = new ChessLib()\n      cl.reset()\n      val moves = line.split(\",\")\n      moves.foreach(move=> {\n        try {\n          val resultMove = Option(cl.move(move))\n          if (resultMove.nonEmpty) {\n            val piece = resultMove.get.piece\n            val to = resultMove.get.strTo\n            map(piece)(mmap(to)) += 1\n          }\n        } catch { case _ => }\n      })\n      map.toSeq\n    }).groupByKey()\n    val map1: RDD[(String, List[Array[Int]])] = key.map(x=> (x._1, x._2.toList))\n\n```\n\nwe start by mapping each line in our input. We initialise a chesslib instance that we will use to process the moves and reset to the starting position of a game. Next we split the CSV into a list of moves and for each move we make chesslib play that move. The result of the move method contains the piece and the square that the move was made to. We take that square and increment the count in the array contained in the map. We will need some grouping to we convert the map into a sequence. So before the sequence the result will be something like\n\n\n```\nMap(\"r\"-> Array(10, 15, 20, 2, ...) //64 of these numbers\nMap(\"r\"-> Array(11, 25, 10, 1, ...) //64 of these numbers\n```\n\n\nafter the conversion to a sequence we will have\n\n\n```\n(\"r\", Array(10, 15, 20, 2, ...)), (\"r\", Array(11, 25, 10, 1, ...)), ...\n\n```\n\nWhy do we need this? because we will merge these maps to sum all the values in the arrays for each piece. The above example states that the rook was on a1 10 times in game 1 and 11 times in game 2. So the heat map will contains 21 for the rook on a1. When we group this sequence by key using the spark provided groupByKey method we will have the following result\n\n\n```\n(\"r\" -&gt; List(Array(10, 15, 20, 2, ...), Array(11, 25, 10, 1, ...) )\n```\n\nwe need to add the corresponding indexes in each array to obtain our result. We will use a helper function for this called combineLists\n\n\n```\ndef combineLists[A](ss:List[Array[A]]) =\n    (ss.head.map(List(_)) /: ss.tail)(_.zip(_).map(p=>p._2 :: p._1))\n```\n\nthis methods takes a list of arrays, and returns a list of zipped lists. To for the input\n\n`List(1,2,3), List(5,6,7), List(7,8,9)`\n\nwe will get the output\n\nNext we need to sum the values in the combined lists for a our final result\n\n\n```\nval map2: RDD[(String, List[Int])] = values.map(x=&gt; (x._1, x._2.map(_.sum).toList))\n```\n\n\nthis will give us the total numbers of moves to each square for each piece. Just what we needed for the heat map!\nBut we still need to do one more thing before we can start the rendering of the map and that is to normalise the values in the array to values between 0 and 1. We can do that using the feature normalisation formula\n\n![](http://imgur.com/l4gwnyv.png)\n\nthe code is like this\n\n\n```\nval map3: RDD[(String, List[Double])] = map2.map(x=&gt; (x._1, x._2.map( y=> (y - x._2.min) / (x._2.max.toDouble - x._2.min) )))\n```\n\n\nnow let\u2019s create our map files as HTML pages with a table containing the heat map\n\n\n```\n   map3.collect().foreach(rdd=> {\n      val tpl = html(rdd._1, rdd._2.mkString(\",\"))\n      new PrintWriter(outputDir + rdd._1 + \".html\") { write(tpl); close}\n    })\n\n```\n\nthe html() function used here is a string template that uses the values between 0 and 1 to create a HLS color for a 5 color heat map. check out the code in the repo \u2013 it\u2019s too verbose to include it in this post.\n\nThat\u2019s about it on how to generate a chess board heat map. Here are the results for 1.5M games analyzed:\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/6hGU74G.png)\n\n![](http://imgur.com/PbJC7Kx.png)\n\n![](http://imgur.com/FHXDfVL.png)\n\n![](http://imgur.com/5I08pXS.png)\n\n![](http://imgur.com/HaHDp9E.png)\n\n![](http://imgur.com/UvNxeq7.png)\n \n\n\n\n\n", "file": "chessboard-heatmap.ipynb"}, {"title": "positional chess", "body": "Here is my new addition to the online chess tools I\u2019m currently working on:\nPositional \u2013 a web based chess position analysis tool.

The trip from Pittsburgh is a relatively long one. Pittsburgh to NY is a 1 hour flight, a 2 hour layout over at JFK, then a 6.5 hour flight to Seattle, only to be greeted by rainy weather. Well what can you do, I guess this is how Seattle is like. We stayed at a corporate housing facility at 1201 Mercer Street and it was quite good. They had everything you could possibly need in the room, from a tumble dryer to a coffee maker. So the first day I got soaking wet strolling around in the city. I took a walk from the apartment to the Seattle Centre going down Mercer street to 5th Ave visiting the Bill And Melinda Gates foundation building, then going down 5th by the Space Needle to Denny Way to the Pacific Science Centre. I thought I'd pay that place a visit but it turned out to be a place for kids so I didn\u2019t want to spend 30$ on that and decided to walk back to the room, as I was a bit under the weather and still feeling tired from the trip the other day. We had some donuts at the Toppot donuts place and headed out to a cocktail. Then we had some good sushi at a place called Japonessa on 1st Ave.\n\nThe next day we were at Pike Place Marker which is a huge farmers market and some other shops. Mostly small local businesses. Interesting shops were a chocolate shop which make genuine chocolate and a hot pepper shop which makes hot chili sauce. The most chili one is made from scorpion pepper extract which I dare not taste. The sauces were expensive, 20$ for about 5 cl of extract. We stopped by the Pike brewery to grab some beer then headed back.\n\nA donut place in Pike Place market\nA donut place in Pike Place market\n\nWe also got to see the first Starbucks shop, which had a long line in front of it with people wanting to drink some coffee there.\n\n*image lost*\n\nWe headed back to the Space Needle after the market place visit, but the weather was cloudy and rainy so we didn't go up. The people who did go up said it wasn't worth it anyway because of the clouds. From the Space Needle we headed to a neighborhood called Ballard and had lunch at a place called Kiss Cafe. Great soup and sandwiches.

This all sounded great and I ordered one immediately but there is one catch: Automatic only supports vehicles in the US. But this wasn't going to stop me from using it! Here are the step I took to get my automatic working.\n\n### App installation\nFirst of all when I did a search for automatic in the google play store, I got back silly results. None of them were the automatic app I was looking for. So I found the exact play store link from their web site, and to my dismay the app could not be installed on devices outside of the US. So the first thing to do is to find the APK (the so called archive for and android app, like an exe for windows) for the android client. After a couple of hours searching I was able to find the 1.5 version of the client (35mb). I had no luck with the evozi tool, I'm uploading my version of the client for others to download it. Once you have to file, just copy it on to your device via a USB cable and run it from the device. Use the file manager to locate the file on your phone and just click it. This will install the automatic app.\n\nupdate: If you are an IOS user, you can download the app by switching the app store country/region to the US. You will need a US credit card or an iTunes gift card. If you have a friend from the US who trusts you enough you can also login with their account to download the app and then logout.\n\n### Dongle installation\nI had no problems installing the dongle on my car. Just locate the ODB port and plugin the device in firmly. It will beep once it's in place and follow the on screen instructions on the phone. You need bluetooth and an internet connection. I had to restart the pairing process a few times because it would not discover the device. But I got it to work after a few tries. When the application is done pairing it will get the VIN from the dongle and will fail because your cars wasn't made/sold in the US, but the application will let you enter a VIN manually. I open a VIN generator and created a random VIN. You can find a VIN generator site here. Just generate a VIN until you get one starting with a 1 or an A.

So you make a choice. The door you chose remains closed but one of the other doors are opened and a goat is revealed (always). Now you are asked the following question: Would you like to change the door you selected, or stay with your initial selection?

We will use the technique called a 10\u00d712 board with sentinel markers. In this method the 8\u00d78 chess board is wrapper with an extra 2 rows at the top and bottom and extra rows on the right and left side as in the figure\n\n![](/img/10x12-board.png)\n\nThe blue squares are the actual chess board and the orange squares the sentinel squares that will come in handy when we are generating moves. You can think of the board as a 2 dimensional array in java. The square with the number 21 is the A1 square and the square 98 is the H8 square of the chess board. We will place our chess pieces in the array locations in this array. So say for example if a white pawn was represented with the value 2 then\n\n`Board[21] = 2`\n\nwould mean that there is a white pawn on A1 (which is not a legal board state for chess \u2013 but just for the sake of an example bear with it)\n\nSo let's dive right in and define a few classes that we will need to represent the board. First of some key squares that we will use throughout our engine go into a class\n\n```\npublic class Squares {\n    public static final int A1 = 21;\n    public static final int B1 = 22;\n    public static final int C1 = 23;\n    public static final int D1 = 24;\n    public static final int E1 = 25;\n    public static final int F1 = 26;\n    public static final int G1 = 27;\n    public static final int H1 = 28;\n \n    public static final int A8 = 91;\n    public static final int B8 = 92;\n    public static final int C8 = 93;\n    public static final int D8 = 94;\n    public static final int E8 = 95;\n    public static final int F8 = 96;\n    public static final int G8 = 97;\n    public static final int H8 = 98;\n    public static final int NOSQ = 99;\n    public static final int OFFBOARD = 100;\n```\nnow we will define some enumerations to make the code more programmer friendly so we don't see magic numbers everywhere\n\n\n\n```\npublic class Rank {\n    public static final int RANK_1 = 0;\n    public static final int RANK_2 = 1;\n    public static final int RANK_3 = 2;\n    public static final int RANK_4 = 3;\n    public static final int RANK_5 = 4;\n    public static final int RANK_6 = 5;\n    public static final int RANK_7 = 6;\n    public static final int RANK_8 = 7;\n    public static final int RANK_NONE = 8;\n}\n\npublic class File {\n\n    public static final int FILE_A = 0;\n    public static final int FILE_B = 1;\n    public static final int FILE_C = 2;\n    public static final int FILE_D = 3;\n    public static final int FILE_E = 4;\n    public static final int FILE_F = 5;\n    public static final int FILE_G = 6;\n    public static final int FILE_H = 7;\n    public static final int FILE_NONE = 8;\n}\n\npublic class File {\n \n    public static final int FILE_A = 0;\n    public static final int FILE_B = 1;\n    public static final int FILE_C = 2;\n    public static final int FILE_D = 3;\n    public static final int FILE_E = 4;\n    public static final int FILE_F = 5;\n    public static final int FILE_G = 6;\n    public static final int FILE_H = 7;\n    public static final int FILE_NONE = 8;\n}\n\npublic class Color {\n    public static final int WHITE = 0;\n    public static final int BLACK = 1;\n    public static final int BOTH = 2;\n}\n\npublic class Color {\n    public static final int WHITE = 0;\n    public static final int BLACK = 1;\n    public static final int BOTH = 2;\n}\n\npublic class Piece {\n    public static final int EMPTY = 0;\n    public static final int wP = 1;\n    public static final int wN = 2;\n    public static final int wB = 3;\n    public static final int wR = 4;\n    public static final int wQ = 5;\n    public static final int wK = 6;\n    public static final int bP = 7;\n    public static final int bN = 8;\n    public static final int bB = 9;\n    public static final int bR = 10;\n    public static final int bQ = 11;\n    public static final int bK = 12;\n}\n\npublic class Piece {\n    public static final int EMPTY = 0;\n    public static final int wP = 1;\n    public static final int wN = 2;\n    public static final int wB = 3;\n    public static final int wR = 4;\n    public static final int wQ = 5;\n    public static final int wK = 6;\n    public static final int bP = 7;\n    public static final int bN = 8;\n    public static final int bB = 9;\n    public static final int bR = 10;\n    public static final int bQ = 11;\n    public static final int bK = 12;\n}\n```\n\nOk these classes are pretty self-explanatory they are a bunch of definitions. Now for some real stuff\n\n```\npublic class Board {\n    public static final int NUM_SQ = 120;\n    int[] filesBoard = new int[NUM_SQ];\n    int[] ranksBoard = new int[NUM_SQ];\n \n    private static Board instance;\n \n    private Board() {\n \n        init();\n    }\n \n    public static Board getInstance() {\n        if (instance == null) {\n            instance = new Board();\n        }\n        return instance;\n    }\n \n    public static int fileRank2Square(int file, int rank) {\n        return 21 + file + rank * 10;\n    }\n \n    public void init() {\n \n        for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SQ; i++) { // part 1\n            filesBoard[i] = Squares.OFFBOARD;\n            ranksBoard[i] = Squares.OFFBOARD;\n        }\n \n        for (int file = File.FILE_A; file <= File.FILE_H ; file++) { // part 2\n            for (int rank = Rank.RANK_1; rank <= Rank.RANK_8; rank++) {\n                int sq = Board.fileRank2Square(file, rank);\n                filesBoard[sq] = file;\n                ranksBoard[sq] = rank;\n            }\n        }\n \n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo we have here a basic initialization of the board. We have 2 arrays here that need attention: filesBoard and  ranksBoard . These two arrays hold the values for ranks and files. So after initialized the files board will look like\n\n![](/img/10x12-fileboard.png)\n\nand the rank file board will look like\n\n![](/img/10x12-rankboard.png)\n\nWe have also a method that will return the index of a square for the given file and rank. So now on to the initialization part. First off we go and set everything slot in both arrays to an off square value to initialize the sentinel squares. Then we loop from file A rank 1 to file H rank 8 basically iterating over all of the squares on the chess board and set the file and rank values appropriately. After this initialization code has run the state of the arrays will like the figures above.\n\nNow lets write a test to make sure that our code is working as expected\n\n```\n@Test\n    public void testFilesBoardInit() {\n        Board b = Board.getInstance();\n        assertTrue(b.ranksBoard[0] == Squares.OFFBOARD);\n        assertTrue(b.ranksBoard[Squares.A1] == Rank.RANK_1);\n        assertTrue(b.filesBoard[Squares.A1] == File.FILE_A);\n \n        assertTrue(b.filesBoard[Squares.C8] == File.FILE_C);\n        assertTrue(b.ranksBoard[Squares.C8] == Rank.RANK_8);\n    }\n```\n\nBoard Flags\n===========\n\nnext some more variables in our board class to hold some board states.\n\n```\nint[] pieces = new int[NUM_SQ];\n    int side = Color.WHITE;\n    int fiftyMoves = 0;\n    int historyPly = 0;\n    int ply = 0;\n    int castlePerms = 0;\n\n```\n\nthe pieces  array will hold the actual pieces as values that we defined in the Pieces class.\n\nthe side  variable holds the current side to move, we just initialize it to white but later we may change it according to a given starting position.\n\nthe fiftyMove  variable is used to determine a draw by fifty moves. This is a lesser known rule in chess so check out this wikipedia page if you don\u2019t know the rule. This variable will get incremented for every move made, and will be reset if a pawn move or a capture happens. If the value every reaches 100 (that\u2019s in half moves, so it\u2019s 50 full moves) then either side is eligible to claim a draw.\n\nthe historyPly  is the number of half-moves (a move by one side) since the beginning of the game. We will use this as an index for undoing moves later.\n\nthe ply  variable is the number of moves in the search tree. Don\u2019t worry about this \u2013 you will understand how it is used during the searching phase and move generation.\n\nthe castlePerms  holds the castling permissions for both sides in an integer. The least significant bit represents white king side castling and the next white queen side castling and so on. So it takes 4 bits to represent all castling permissions. In the class CastleMask we define these bits. So to check if a white can castle king side all we need to do is bit wise and the castlePerms  variable with the corresponding value in CastleMask . Bit wise operations are a bit scary for most people so brush up on your bit wise operations by checking out this article.\n\nHere is the CastleMask class that we use to check the castling permissions\n\n```\npublic class CastleMask {\n    int wk = 1;\n    int wq = 2;\n    int bk = 4;\n    int bq = 8;\n}\n```\n\nSo for example if the castle permissions had a value of 3 which is 0011 in binary and we wanted to check if white can castle queen side we would do this operation castlePerm & CastleMask.wq  and check if the result of this operation is 0 or 1. If it is 1 then white can castle queen side. If you apply this operation 0011 and 0010 ( CastleMask.wq  is 2 which is this in binary) the result will be 1 so white can castle queen side.\n\n\nPiece lists\n===========\n\nWhen we want to generate moves for the pieces on the board the first approach that comes to mind is looping through all the squares on the board and checking if the current square has a piece of the correct color for the side to move and generating the moves for that piece. But by using some extra memory \u2013 only very little we can do a bit better. Instead of going through the squares we will track pieces and know on which square that piece is currently sitting. Before we implement this idea lets add a few convenience variable that we will use later on for look-ups. So in Piece.java we need the following\n\n\n```\n    public int[] pieces = new int[]{EMPTY, wP, wN, wB, wR, wQ, wK, bP, bN, bB, bR, bQ, bK};\n    public boolean[] pieceBig = new boolean[]{false, false, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true};\n    public boolean[] pieceMaj = new boolean[]{false, false, false, false, true, true, true, false, false, false, true, true, true};\n    public boolean[] pieceMin = new boolean[]{false, false, true, true, false, false, false, false, true, true, false, false, false};\n    public int[] pieceVal = new int[]{0, 100, 325, 325, 550, 1000, 50000, 100, 325, 325, 550, 1000, 50000};\n    public int[] pieceCol = new int[]{Color.BOTH, Color.WHITE, Color.WHITE, Color.WHITE, Color.WHITE, Color.WHITE, \n        Color.WHITE,Color.BLACK, Color.BLACK, Color.BLACK, Color.BLACK, Color.BLACK, Color.BLACK};\n    public boolean[] piecePawn = new boolean[]{false, true, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false};\n    public boolean[] pieceKnight = new boolean[]{false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false};\n    public boolean[] pieceKing = new boolean[]{false, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, true};\n    public boolean[] pieceRookQueen = new boolean[]{false, false, false, false, true, true, false, false, false, false, true, true, false};\n    public boolean[] pieceBishopQueen = new boolean[]{false, false, false, true, false, true, false, false, false, true, false, true, false};\n    public boolean[] pieceSlides = new boolean[]{false, false, false, true, true, true, false, false, false, true, true, true, false};\n\n```\n\nThese are just some look-up tables and they are pretty simple but I\u2019ll explain one just as an example. The pieceVal[]  array holds the values for each piece indexed by the piece index in the pieces[]  array. So the first element in the  pieces[]  array is EMPTY with an index of 0. The the element at pieceVal[0]  is also 0 because an empty piece does not have a value. The next element in the pieces[]  array at pieces[1]  is a white pawn. So the value in the pieceVal[1]  array is 100 signifying the value of a pawn etc. You get the basic idea behind this, feel free to leave a comment if anything is unclear.\n\nNow let\u2019s get back to the piece lists. In Board.java we need the following arrays\n\n\n```\nint[] material = new int[2]; //WHITE,BLACK;\n    int[] pceNum = new int[13];\n    int[] pList = new int[130];\n    int enPassantSquare = 0;\n```\n\nThe material[]  array holds the total value of material present at the board indexed by color. So if the white side has a single pawn on the board material[0]  would 100. Simple enough.\n\nThe pceNum[]  array holds the number of pieces of a certain type on the board. This is again using the Piece.pieces[]  as the index. So the index of a white pawn is 1 in the pieces array, so pceNum[1]  would be 5 if there were 5 white pawns on the board. The pList[] array holds the squares for each of the pieces on the board. There can be a maximum of 10 pieces of the same kind on the board at a given state. How is that possible you ask? This is an edge case but think about this scenario: I promote each of may eight pawns to rooks and I already have my two rooks so that makes a total of ten rooks for me. Taking this logic into account we set aside ten slots for each piece. So the following position\n\n![](/img/ah9syj4hw36s.png)\n\nwould have pceNum[1]  = 8 and pList = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,A2,B2,C2,...]  where A2 is the actual integer value of the board index. To get the square from the piece list all we have to do is multiply the piece integer representation by 10 and to get the beginning index in the pList[] array then we can get the next pceNum[piece integer value] elements. Let\u2019s add that to the Board class\n\n\n```\n  public static int pieceIndex(int piece, int pieceNum) {\n        return piece * 10 + pieceNum;\n    }\n\n```\n\nPosition Hashing\n================\n\nIn this part we will lay the foundation of our position hashing. Position hashing is mapping a unique value to each unique position on the board. What makes a position unique? It\u2019s basically the pieces on the board, and which squares they are on. If we have two knights on the board we cannot call this unique because we haven\u2019t stated the squares the knights are on. But if we say two knights on the board on squares A1 and A8 we can say this is a unique position. We also have to factor in the side to play, the castling statuses and any en passant squares (If you don\u2019t know what en passant means, take a look here). We will use a method called zorbist hashing to achieve this. The essentials of the hashing algorithm are like this: First we generate a random number for pieces on the board and XOR this with the current key. Then we XOR the resulting value with the side to move and XOR the resulting key with the en passant square etc until we have used all our defining attributes. Let\u2019s do an example to solidify. Say that we have 3 pieces p1, p2 and p3 and our key k.\n\n\n```\np1 = random();\np2 = random();\np3 = random();\nk = 0;\n```\n\nwe initialized our pieces and our key. Next up XOR\n\n\n```\nk = k XOR p1\nk = k XOR p2\nk = k XOR p3\n```\n\nthis will yield our final key for the position (we have discarded en passant and the other stuff for simplicity). The nice thing about this hashing is that if we want to take out p1 from the hash we don\u2019t have to reconstruct the hash from the beginning for p2 and p3, we can just XOR p1 out of the hash like this\n\n\n```\nk = k XOR p1\n```\n\nand this would give the same result as doing\n\n\n```\nk = 0\nk = k XOR p2\nk = k XOR p3\n```\n\nSo here is our random number generator and our variable to hold the position key that goes into our Board class\n\n\n```\npublic static int random() {\n        return ((int)Math.floor((Math.random()*255)+1) << 23) | ((int)Math.floor((Math.random()*255)+1) << 16)\n                | ( (int) Math.floor((Math.random()*255)+1) << 8) | (int) Math.floor((Math.random()*255)+1);\n \n    }\n    int posKey = 0;\n\n```\n\nPosition hashing and key generation\n===================================\n\nIn this part we will incorporate the hashing into our engine. We will introduce a new class called Hash that will take care of all hashing related functions. We will need to initialize a table for each piece and square combination, a hashing key for side to move and for the castling permissions. Here is the definition part in code\n\n```\npublic  int[] pieceKeys = new int[13 * 120];\n    public  int sideKey;\n    public  int[] castleKey = new int[16];\n    public static Hash instance;\n\n```\n\nThe reason we are using 13 x 120 is that our board has sentinel squares around it and it\u2019s a total of 120 squares for 13 piece types. The castling permissions is a 4 bit number which is 16 in decimal so we use an array of length 16. We will be applying the singleton pattern that is why we defined an instance variable. Now let\u2019s initialize these tables with some values\n\n\n```\nprivate Hash() {}\n    public static Hash getInstance() {\n        if (instance == null) {\n            instance = new Hash();\n        }\n        return instance;\n    }\n \n    public void initHashKeys() {\n        for (int i = 0; i < 13 * 120; i++) {\n            pieceKeys[i] = Board.random();\n        }\n        sideKey = Board.random();\n        for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {\n            castleKey[i] = Board.random();\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThis is fairly simple, we just put a random number for every slot in all the arrays. Moving on to the actual key generation:\n\n```\npublic int generatePosKey() {\n        int finalKey = 0;\n        for (int sq = 0; sq < Board.NUM_SQ; sq++) {\n            int piece = Board.getInstance().pieces[sq];\n            if (piece != Piece.EMPTY && piece != Squares.OFFBOARD) {\n                finalKey ^= pieceKeys[(piece * 120) + sq];\n            }\n        }\n        if (Board.getInstance().side == Color.WHITE) {\n            finalKey ^= sideKey;\n        }\n \n        if (Board.getInstance().enPassantSquare != Squares.NOSQ) {\n            finalKey ^= pieceKeys[Board.getInstance().enPassantSquare];\n        }\n        finalKey ^= castleKey[Board.getInstance().castlePerms];\n        return finalKey;\n    }\n\n```\n\nOk, here we iterate through all of the squares on the board (including the sentinels) and if there is a piece on that square and it is not a sentinel square we get the corresponding random number from our previously generated pieceKeys[]  array and XOR it with the hash key. Remember we laid our our pieceKeys[]  array by piece type and 120 slots for each piece type. So we can access it by multiplying the piece integer value with 120 and adding the square. We incorporate the side to move into the key if it\u2019s white or skip it for black. If the en passant square is set we also XOR that into our key. We could have also accessed the pieceKeys[]  like this for en passant pieceKeys[Piece.EMPTY * 120 + sq]  but Piece.EMTPY is zero so we can leave it out.\n\nWe can also add some tests to verify that our initialization and generation are working as expected\n\n\n```\n@Test\n    public void shouldInitHashKeys() {\n        Hash.getInstance().initHashKeys();\n        for (int i = 0; i < 13 * 120; i++) {\n            int pieceKey = Hash.getInstance().pieceKeys[i];\n            assertTrue(pieceKey != 0);\n        }\n        assertTrue(Hash.getInstance().sideKey != 0);\n        for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {\n            assertTrue(Hash.getInstance().castleKey[i] != 0);\n        }\n    }\n \n    @Test\n    public void shouldGeneratePosKey() {\n        Board.getInstance().pieces[21] = Piece.wP;\n        Hash.getInstance().initHashKeys();\n        int key = Hash.getInstance().generatePosKey();\n        assertTrue(key != 0);\n    }\n\n```\n", "file": "anatomy-of-a-chess-engine.ipynb"}, {"title": "groovy templates variable passing", "body": "\nGroovy Templates is one of the new cool kids on the block. It enables you to ditch the stinky old templates like FreeMarker or Velocity and use groovy to write your templates, which basically means no more eyes bleeding from angled brackets and HTML syntax.

The fire_anim variable is set to true at the fire() method of the player and a timer is set to disable in after 10ms have passed.\n\nPlayer keybinding\n=================\n\nthe a,s,d,w and keys are bound using the javascript evet handler. The a,s keys set the current player Y velocity to +maxspeed and -maxspeed and the a,d keys set the X velocity to -max and +max. They are triggered by the keydown event, and at each move() function call the coordinates are updated according to the value of the velocity variable. The keyup event sets these variables to zero. This way if the key is held in a pressed state the actor will keep moving.\n\nPlayer movement\n===============\n\nthe direction of the player is calculated by taking the atan2 of the current player x,y and the current mouse x,y so that the player is always facing towards the cross-hair. If the velocity of the player is 0 than the current player sprite isn\u2019t swapped because we don\u2019t want the player to perform a moving animation otherwise the seconds that have passed from the game start is calculated form the current frame number and FPS and the correct sprite is selected form the sprite array of the player.\n\nPlayer rendering\n================\n\nThe player is rendered on the canvas by translating the canvas to the player x,y and rotating the canvas by the player direction and drawing the current sprite from the sprite index.\n\nPlayer weapon firing\n====================\n\nIf the bullet count is 0 the weapon is reloaded. Then a bullet object is created an pushed on the projectiles array.\n\n\n\nProjectile system\n=================\n\nProjectiles are bullets fired by weapons. A weapon may fire multiple projectiles e.g shotgun. Rockets are also projectiles.The projectiles are stored in the C.projectiles array when they are displayable on the screen. Different types of projectiles may be present with different velocities and different damage factors. Location of the bullet is calculated each frame by the main event loop. Collision detection is performed at each frame with each zombie on the screen. If a collision is true the projectile is removed from the C.projectiles array.\n\nEffects\n=======\n\n* projectiles are small but visible to the user\n* projectiles should leave a trail of smoke or something to indicate the path. this trail is calculated by saving the x,y at the bullets creation time and drawing a line gradient with a fading alpha form the current x,y position of the bullet to saved position\n\n\nMonotonic Trajectory\n====================\n\n* at the time of firing the bullet life is 0 and incremented each frame\n* the x,y of the projectile is the player x,y at the time of firing.\n* the direction angle phi is calculated as the angle between the x-axis and the line between the player x,y and an x,y at a random point in the crosshair circle\nat each frame the next x,y is current x,y + sin(direction)/cos(direction) * velocity * bullet life\n\nProjectile direction angle\n\n![](/img/57f4527f8642c.png)\n\nProjectile Trajectory\n\n![](/img/57f45298050e8.png)\n\nAccuracy\n========\n\nThe crosshair of the player widens with consecutives shots less than N seconds apart. The trajectory of the projectile intersect at a random point within this widend cross hair circle.\n", "file": "carbine.ipynb"}, {"title": "turkiyeden s.ktir olup gitmek", "body": "\nBos beles ve bir o kadar les bir troll yuvasi olan eksisozluk ve diger \n\u201cproduct sensin sana kafam girsin\u201d business modeli ile calisan content. \nhostingcileri zengin etmemek adina artik internette kendim sahibi olmadigim \nhic bir platforma byte harcamiyorum.

Just because the symbols are too small to accurately touch on the screen and buttons on the touch screen are annoying to tap continously. You need a keyboard, period. I had the game working with Mac Catalyst but that just seemed weird, so I ported the code base to macos. I tried modifying the existing project in place but that lead to weird configuration errors so I just started a new macos project and copied over most of the code.\n\nI ran into issues with setting color on the tile textures due to NSColor not liking the color space when I used SKColor built in enum values so I had to create and instance for the coloring. Resizing the window was also much harder than I would have imagined but I got it working with some research. The rest was pretty straightforward substituting UIKit stuff with NS stuff. I had to do the keyboard input handling code again as that was also not compatible.\n\nI discovered some unfairness issues with the scheduler so I rewrote that part to use a credit based system instead of the future scheduling time line system. It looks to be a lot better now.\n\nI also had the chance to dive into the animation pipeline that runs async code sequentially. The trick was to use a dispatch group and a semaphore to coordinate the queued animations. I still feel like there is an issue with the delay timing in the animations like the sleep calls aren\u2019t waiting the correct amount of time that I need to look into.", "file": "kogmind_2020-06-10.ipynb"}, {"title": "roguelike time system", "body": "\n*This post contains a series of updates to an algorithm that show the evaluation and rationale. You don't end up with what you started.*\n\nThe most naive scheduler in a rogue like is just assuming that every character moves at the same speed and iterating over the list to make them move. But that is boring and diminishes the tactics in the game. A huge slug should be slower than the player and a vampire bat should be faster.\n\nA simple way of accomplishing this is to use a priority queue. Each character in the world has a plan function that calculates the move it will make and enqueues it with the scheduler to be executed at a certain time. This time should be the current time + the cost to execute the action. For the human player this plan function is partly when the human is thinking what to do and partly in the input handler for the (when the action is sent to the queue).\n\nAfter a player input is received the scheduler starts dequeuing the items and executing them. The current time is updated to the time of the action that was executed. This works because of the priority queue and the first item dequeued is the item with the lowest timestamp value. This goes on until a player action is dequeued and executed. One thing to note here is that of actions with the same timestamp the player action should be the last so that other characters actions don't spill over to the next tick.\n\n## Example execution\nPlayer (P) movement cost is 50\nMonster (M) movement cost is 25\n\nSo we expect the M to move 2 tiles when the player moves 1.\nThe queue is initially empty and the game asks all entities to plan their move. M plans it's move based on it's AI output and queues it with the scheduler\n\n```\n[M(25)]\n```\n\nNow we are waiting for player input. Let's say the player pressed a movement key so we schedule that\n\n```\n[M(25), P(50)]\n```\n\nThe input from the player also triggers the scheduler execution. The scheduler gets the first item in the queue and executes the action and updates the current time from 0 to 25. After execution it asks for the owner of that item to run its planning again. So the monster again consults its AI and plans another move. The move is scheduled so the queue is now\n\n```\n[M(50), P(50)]\n```\n\nThe scheduler hasn't yet seen a command that belongs to the player so it keeps on dequeuing. The next item is again a monster action so it's dequeued and executed, current time is updated to 50 and another plan is requested. The plan is added to the queue so it is now\n\n```\n[P(50), M(75)]\n```\n\nNext up is the player action which is dequeued and executed and the scheduler loop can be terminated, leaving the queue as\n\n```\n[M(75)]\n```\n\nwhich is the same state as our initial queue.\n\n\n\n## Update 2: Remove planning phase\n\nThe plan & execute system has a design flaw that requires the action code to perform checks which kind leads to either poor code structure or unfair scheduling behavior.\nThe issue first surfaced when I saw that 2 monsters would end up occupying the same tile. Consider the following map setup\n\n```\n########\n....M...\n###N####\n  #.#\n  #.#\n```  \n  \nAssume that M wants to go left and N wants to go up. When the scheduler asks M for the next M moves, M checks the location on the left and sees thats it's empty so plans a move it that direction. Next N sees that the same location is empty and also plans a move in that direction. Now in the action phase you need to check whether the target location is empty before making the move otherwise the monsters end up being on top of each other. But what does N do if the location is not empty in the action phase? N already spent credits to plan the turn so either N would have to choose an action with the same cost (to make it cost fair) or choose some other action that could cost less or more (or maybe skip the action). All of these seem like unfair solutions. The same unfairness happens when M plans to attack the player but the player isn't there because they got more turns than M. So this type of plan and then execute model is not really suitable.\nI came up with an alternate model where all the actors in the world are added to priority queue again. But this time around there is no planning phase there is only an action phase. Once the actor executes their action, the action function returns the cost of the action, which is then used to determine the place of the action in the queue. Again queue processing terminates when it's the players turn so we can get input.\n\nHere is an example run:\n\ninitially everybody is waiting in the queue\n\n\n```\n[P(0), M(0), N(0)]\n```\n\nPlayer moves with cost 100\n\n```\n[M(0), N(0), P(100)]\n```\n\nM moves with cost 50\n\n```\n[N(0), M(50), P(100)]\n```\n\nN moves with cost 50\n\n```\n[M(50), N(50), P(100)]\n```\n\nM moves with cost 50\n\n```\n[N(50), P(100), M(100)]\n```\n\nN moves with cost 50\n\n```\n[P(100), M(100), N(100)]\n```\n\n\nnow we are at the player again, so M, N moved twice for each player move which is correct since their movement cost is half that of the player.\n\n\n## Update 3: Sentinel\nWith the new turn system an issue that came up is when the turn processing stops with the player any other actor that was scheduled to act on the same tick gets delayed for a turn. This again leads to unfair time sharing situations. The fix is relatively easy: add a new actor called the TurnSentinel that acts as the demarcation between turns. It has a fixed action cost of the turn length which should be the same as the players movement cost to avoid situations where the player would move more or less than 1 square per turn. With this update the queue structure becomes like this\n\n```\n[P(0), M(0), N(0), TS(100)]\n```\n\nsay all the actors took actions that cost 100 points, then the queue becomes\n\n```\n[TS(100), P(100), M(100), N(100)]\n```\n\nwe calculate the sentinel action put it to the back of the queue and we terminate the scheduler processing loop because we see the sentinel and wait for player input.\n\n```\n[P(100), M(100), N(100), TS(200)]\n```\n\n## Update 4: Credit system\nI still ran into unfairness issues or other weird behavior with monsters moving more than they should in a turn because of their place in the queue so I decided to switch to an energy based system. It's still similar to the time based execution system but now each actor gets N credits each tick and action costs are deducted from their available credits. I didn't want to change the action api to allow for a credit check as that would mean running the AI twice. One for possibly selecting the action to see the cost then actually running it. This also imposes limits on the actions and NPCs would be could be biased on efficient credit usage rather than best actions. If the actor has a positive credit the scheduler will execute their actions until they run out of credits. This implies that they could end up with a negative balance. The next tick they will get N more credits and can execute their action if they end with a positive balance otherwise they'll have to wait for the next turn. The waiting is ok for the npcs but not the player. You can't have the player press a key and nothing happen because they had a negative credit balance. The solution to this issue is to recursively run the scheduler if the player credits are below -N. Why -N and not zero? Because if they have more than -N they will get N more in the next tick and the player action will execute. That means the last action will be executed twice which is not what we want.\n\nLet's say the action cost is 150, default charge per turn is 100. Every body started with 0 credit.\n1. Charge: credits 100\n2. Spend: credits -50\n3. Charge: credits 50\n4. Spend: credits -100\n\nNow when you charge the next tick, the player will have 0 credits and not move. To prevent this a recursive call is made so every other actor gets their action and the player is now 0.\n\n1. Charge: credits 100\n\nand the player can move again.\n\n\n## Update 5\nThe credits system is working pretty good except for a couple of conditions that arisen due to the position of the player in the queue and animations. This was mainly related to the displacement mechanic that I wanted to implement and how I could have the user perceive that displacement. The player has to be in first position in the queue because when they do a ranged target, I want to calculate if the shot hit the target first. If the player is not first to go, then the monsters could change their location and the shot would miss. This could be accomplished by a preemptive scheduler that queue the shot as a `Schedulable` then the player could go last but I have to think about that a bit more. A side from that I also changed the implementation to a round robin traversal instead of consuming all the credits of the current actor. I put all the `schedulables` in to a local queue in the tick function and process that queue. If the current actor has any credits left after their action they get put back in the queue in last position and the processing continues until the queue is empty.\n\n\nMy initial design for the time system was running on the main thread sequentially and the game would render the level at the end of a scheduler tick. This seemed to work well but if an actor gets more than 1 movement action per tick it would look like they jumped around. I decided that this can get hard to judge and predict the next monster location for fast monsters. One turn the monster is far away the next turn it jumped right next to the player. So I wanted to animate the monster movements so it's clear how the enemies are moving. This seems to be a bit more fair in terms of time sharing for all the actors and makes the queue position a bit less important.", "file": "roguelike-time-system.ipynb"}, {"title": "a renderer for roguelike games on ios/macos", "body": "# Renderer\n\n22nd June 2020 at 9:47pm\n\n**This code is taken from the brogue [source code](https://github.com/tmewett/BrogueCE) and slightly modified.**\n\nRendering the map on screen is maybe the most important part of the game. I chose to develop this game on the iOS platform (possibily also on macOS) and use the libraries provided by Apple. The architecture should be portable to other platforms as most game development platforms are built around the same core concepts of scene graphs, and nodes with textures (sprites) that draw objects on the screen. Coordinate system maybe different (e.g the origin may be the top left of the screen or bottom left) but the basics are the same.\n\nThe idea is simple:\n\n1. create a cache of textures for each glyph that will be used in the game\n2. create a scene graph with empty sprite nodes\n3. adjust each cell by updating it's texture, colors and illumination based on the level map.\n\nI take a layered approach to rendering the map by first rendering the level, then characters and FoV for the player.\n\n## Texture Cache\n\nThe texture cache generates an image dynamically with the glyph that is requested and caches the result internally as it will be used over and over again. A detail here is that you need to calculate a scaling factor to make sure the glyphs are scaled correctly to fit any screen size and map size.\n\n```\nprivate func createTexture(glyph: String, size: CGSize) -> SKTexture {\n    let fontSize = CGFloat(130)\n    var scaleFactor: CGFloat {\n        let font = UIFont(name: \"Menlo\", size: fontSize)!\n        let attr = [NSAttributedString.Key.font: font]\n        let opts = NSStringDrawingOptions.usesFontLeading\n        let bounds = glyph.boundingRect(with: CGSize(width: 0, height: 0), options: opts, attributes: attr, context: nil)\n        let factor = min(size.width / bounds.width, size.height / bounds.height)\n        return factor\n    }\n    let font = UIFont(name: \"Menlo\", size: fontSize * scaleFactor)!\n    UIGraphicsBeginImageContext(size)\n    let fontAttr = [NSAttributedString.Key.font: font, NSAttributedString.Key.foregroundColor: SKColor.white]\n    let realBounds: CGRect = glyph.boundingRect(with: CGSize(width: 0, height: 0),\n                                        options: [.usesFontLeading],\n                                        attributes: fontAttr,\n                                        context: nil)\n    let stringOrigin = CGPoint(x: (size.width - realBounds.width)/2 - realBounds.origin.x,\n                               y: font.descender - realBounds.origin.y + (size.height - realBounds.height)/2)\n    glyph.draw(at: stringOrigin, withAttributes: fontAttr)\n    let surface = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()\n \n    UIGraphicsEndImageContext()\n    let texture = SKTexture(image: surface!)\n    self.textureMap[glyph] = texture\n    return texture\n     \n}\n```\n\n**Scene graph**\n\nWe need some nodes in the scene graph that will contain these textures. This is pretty straight forward and we generate row x col empty nodes for the backgroun, the same number for the foreground and add them as children to the root of the graph with the same location but different z-index values. The background node doesn't need a texture as we won't be printing a glyph on it but we'll just be adjusting its color. It's also a good idea to wrap these 2 nodes in a Cell object as we have an illumination attribute that will effect these nodes.\n\n```\nstatic let defaultIllumination: CGFloat = 0.3\nlet foreground: SKSpriteNode\nlet background: SKSpriteNode\nvar illumination: CGFloat\nvar glyph: SKTexture? {\n    set(newGlyph) {\n        foreground.texture  = newGlyph\n    }\n    get {\n        return foreground.texture\n    }\n}\nvar fgcolor: SKColor {\n    set(newColor) {\n        let rgba = newColor.rgba\n        foreground.color = SKColor(red: CGFloat(rgba.red * illumination),\n                                   green: CGFloat(rgba.green * illumination),\n                                   blue: CGFloat(rgba.blue * illumination),\n                                   alpha: CGFloat(rgba.alpha))\n    }\n    get {\n        return foreground.color\n    }\n}\nvar bgcolor: SKColor {\n    set(newColor) {\n        background.color = newColor\n    }\n    get {\n        return background.color\n    }\n}\ninit(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat, size:CGSize) {\n    foreground = SKSpriteNode(color: .white, size: size)\n    background = SKSpriteNode(color: .clear, size: size)\n    foreground.colorBlendFactor = 1\n    background.colorBlendFactor = 1\n    foreground.position = CGPoint(x: x, y: y)\n    background.position = CGPoint(x: x, y: y)\n    foreground.zPosition = 1\n    foreground.anchorPoint = CGPoint.zero\n    background.anchorPoint = CGPoint.zero\n    illumination = Self.defaultIllumination\n}\n```\n\n**Drawing a cell**\n\nNow in the game scene we add the nodes that the Cell object exposes to the scene graph\n\n```\nfor x in 0..<cols {\n    var row = [Cell]()\n    for y in 0..<rows {\n        let newCell = Cell(x: CGFloat(x) * cellWidth,\n                           y: CGFloat(rows - y - 1) * cellHeight,\n                           size: CGSize(width: cellWidth, height: cellHeight))\n        row.append(newCell)\n    }\n    cells.append(row)\n}\n \nfor x in 0..<cols {\n    for y in 0..<rows {\n        addChild(cells[x][y].background)\n        addChild(cells[x][y].foreground)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAt this point we can refer to any node by cells[x][y].{foreground,background} to update its glyph, texture or illumination value. It's worth putting this update in its own function as it will be used in different places when rendering:\n\n```\npublic func setCell(x: Int, y: Int, code: UInt32, bgColor: CGColor, fgColor: CGColor, illumination: CGFloat = 1.0) {\n    cells[x][y].illumination = illumination\n    cells[x][y].fgcolor = SKColor(cgColor: fgColor)\n    cells[x][y].bgcolor = SKColor(cgColor: bgColor)\n     \n    if let glyph = UnicodeScalar(code) {\n        cells[x][y].glyph = textureCache.getTexture(glyph: String(glyph))\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Further thoughts**\n\nThis is an efficient way of rendering the level on the screen as there is minimal scene graph manipulation and we are just updating textures and colors. I have not looked in detail into how illumination and lighting could be implemented to be more realistic but this simple method of multiplicatively modifying RGB values seems to result in an OK result.\n\n**Update 2 - Graph based rendering**\n\nI mentioned that I took a layered approach to rendering which meant that there was a render method in GameScene that would take all the objects to be rendered as parameters and render them in order. The ordering is important because things overwrite each other. If you render the FoV before the player you will not see the player symbol '@' as it will be overwritten by a bright dot (the location of the player is always in the FoV). I decided that it would be a cleaner approach to have all the object render themselves and keep track of their dependencies that also need rendering. E.g the player now has a FoV object that it will ask to render itself before rendering itself (A lot of it selves there ...).\n\nThis is accomplished by having a Renderable protocol that takes the GameScene which contains the actually methods to manipulate textures on the screen. The Game object has a reference to the GameScene object to it can pass it along to the objects that are Renderable.\n\n**Update 3: Animation overlay**\n\nAfter starting work on the animations I realized that using the illumination system to render explosion effects with alpha channel was going to be a pain because of the transparency required. I would need to find the glyphs for the tiles that have the explosion effect and adjust illumination to give a transparency / lighting effect. Even with this approach I still wouldn't get exactly what I wanted as the effects that illumination provide even when applied to the background is not really what an explosion or laser charing effect look like.

I wanted to setup an nginx proxy that would be the front end to all these services and also wanted to use human friendly addresses. The simple option would be to add all the hostnames to my `etc/resolv.conf` file but I use 5 different devices daily and some of them don't even allow me to change that file. So I needed to run my own DNS server. The idea was to capture requests made to `*.dendiz.lan` and resolve them to my docker host and forward all other requests to my usual DNS servers. \n\nDNS configs can be tricky but a project called coredns makes it very simple. The DNS itself is also a docker container which keeps things even cleaner. So I spun up a coredns container with following dns records file\n\n```\n$ORIGIN dendiz.lan.\n@\t3600 IN\tSOA sns.dns.icann.org. noc.dns.icann.org.

I built the executable, created the docker image and started the container. Ran a bunch dig requests like\n\n```\ndig @localhost -p 53 www.dendiz.lan A\n```\n\nand got back an answer section. Nice! Next up creating the proxies... I found a nice project called nginx proxy manager that provides a web interface for creating proxy configs which also runs in a container. I installed that and created proxy hosts for all the services that I use and everything was looking good. one caveat with this setup is that I had manually set the DNS servers in the network settings on my devices. The solution to this issue was to configure my routers internet settings and put in my DNS server as the first server to use. Now all the devices that use DHCP can resolve my local domain. \n", "file": "local-dns-server.ipynb"}, {"title": "consumption 12/2020", "body": "\nI've decided to write about the articles and other interesting media I have consumed each month.\nThis is the first post in that series and it covers the months of November and December 2020\n\n## 3 takes aways from Quantopian shutting down\n\n- You can't crowd source alpha - The business models was to see if the masses could come up with a way to beat the markets\ngiven the tools.

The cycles alternate between FinDev and GameDev. \nIn this GameDev cycle I\u2019ve decided to take a more pragmatic approach to a new \nproject (one that I know will be abandoned like the million others). It all \nstarted with a news letter that I get from WarGamingVault. This is a website \nthat sells rule books for table top games. I was looking through the best \nsellers of the month and I saw a rule book that was advertised as \u201csimple to \nplay star ship battles\u201d. I knew that figuring our the game mechanics is a ton \nof work running hundreds maybe thousands of test play to tune those numbers and \nrules to get a balanced game, so I though why not just stand on the shoulders of\nsome one that has already put in that work? There was only one comment on the \nbook from a guy who bought a lot of books from that site and wrote reviews for \nthem. The author also had a blog where he published action reports and he \nseemed pretty active so I went ahead and purchased it for $14.\n\nThe book is about 50 pages and can be condensed to maybe 30 with the actual \nmechanics of the game play. They do seem simple enough for a table top game but \nputting those rules in a program and adding the polish to it is going to be a \nlot of work. I went through the rules and took notes on the sequence of the play\nas a starting point. I had some open questions and sent an email to the author \nwho answered them the next day. With a basic understanding of the game I started\nworking on an iOS version. I started out with UIKit but soon realized that \nit\u2019s a lot of unnecessary work when you don\u2019t use a game engine for a game so \nI switched to Godot. I didn\u2019t really like the dynamic python like scripting \nlanguage from my previous experiences building join5 and ITTB but decided the \nstick with GDScript even though Godot officially supports C# now because of the \ndeeper integration with the editor and the simplicity of the game. I\u2019m thinking \nthat I\u2019ll continue with GDScript for at least the 2D prototype.\n\nOk, enough preamble now to what I\u2019ve been doing. I started out with a quick \nrefresher of Godot and went through their official documentation. Then I created\nthe new project and added the scene. Next I added some simple GUI elements for \neach of the steps in the turn sequence and the code that transitions between \nthese states. For now it\u2019s pretty manual and hardcoded but it should be enough. \nThe worst part about building games is that I have to work in GIMP to make \nsprites and things which I\u2019m really not good at, but I still managed import a \nspace ship sprite from opengamearts.org and made a target selector sprite by \nmyself.

Making the whole level visible would lead to boring games so the area is limited to a certain radius. There are a couple of different algorithms that can be used to implement FoV. I choose to go with the simplest which is ray casting from the player position towards the outer rim of a circle that is defined by the how far the player can see.\n\n![image](/img/fov1.jpg)\n\n## Ray casting\n\nThe algorithm is pretty straight forward. Calculate the rim of the circle defined by the radius R that corresponds to the maximum distance the player can see. Don't forget to clamp the coordinates returned by this function to the limits of the map. You can get negative coordinates (or more generally out of bounds coordinates) if the player is standing at the top left edge of the map. The ide\n\n```\nprivate static func rim(origin: XY, radius: Int) -> [XY]{\n    var result = [XY]()\n    var x = radius, y = 0\n    var P = 1 - radius\n    result.append(XY(x: origin.x, y: origin.y + radius))\n    result.append(XY(x: origin.x, y: origin.y - radius))\n    result.append(XY(x: origin.x + radius, y: origin.y))\n    result.append(XY(x: origin.x - radius, y: origin.y))\n    while x > y {\n        y += 1\n        if P <= 0 {\n            P = P + 2 * y + 1\n        } else {\n            x -= 1\n            P = P + 2*y - 2*x + 1\n        }\n        if x < y {\n            break\n        }\n        result.append(XY(x: origin.x + x, y: origin.y + y))\n        result.append(XY(x: origin.x - x, y: origin.y + y))\n        result.append(XY(x: origin.x + x, y: origin.y - y))\n        result.append(XY(x: origin.x - x, y: origin.y - y))\n \n        if x != y {\n            result.append(XY(x: origin.x + y, y: origin.y + x))\n            result.append(XY(x: origin.x - y, y: origin.y + x))\n            result.append(XY(x: origin.x + y, y: origin.y - x))\n            result.append(XY(x: origin.x - y, y: origin.y - x))\n        }\n    }\n    return result\n}\n```\n\nNow we have a bunch of target coordinates that we can shoot rays at. When shooting the rays the only thing that you need to check for is to make sure you don't penetrate blocking tiles like walls. This is a simple check when we are drawing a virtual line from the origin to the target. We stop drawing if we hit a wall. Drawing a line uses Bresenham's rasterized line drawing method.\n\n```\npublic static func bresenham(x0: Int, y0: Int, x1: Int, y1: Int) -> [XY] {\n    var result = [XY]()\n    var dx = x1 - x0\n    var dy = y1 - y0\n    let xsign = dx > 0 ? 1 : -1\n    let ysign = dy > 0 ? 1 : -1\n    dx = abs(dx)\n    dy = abs(dy)\n \n    var xx: Int, xy: Int, yx: Int, yy: Int\n    if dx > dy {\n        xx = xsign\n        xy = 0\n        yx = 0\n        yy = ysign\n    } else {\n        let t = dx\n        dx = dy\n        dy = t\n        xx = 0\n        xy = ysign\n        yx = xsign\n        yy = 0\n    }\n    var D = 2*dy - dx\n    var y = 0\n    for x in 0...dx {\n        result.append(XY(x: x0 + x * xx + y*yx, y: y0 + x*xy + y*yy))\n        if D >= 0 {\n            y += 1\n            D -= 2 * dx\n        }\n        D += 2*dy\n    }\n    return result\n}\n```\n\nNow that we have a way of casting the rays, we just need a loop that sends a ray to each of the targets.\n\n```\nstatic func naiveFov(origin: XY, radius: Int, level: [[Tile]]) -> [XY] {\n    let rows = level.count\n    let cols = level[0].count\n    let rim = Set(Self.rim(origin: origin, radius: radius)\n      .map { XY(x: clamp($0.x, min: 0, max: cols), y: clamp($0.y, min: 0, max: rows)) })\n    var lit = [XY]()\n    for target in rim {\n        let ray = Bresenham.bresenham(x0: origin.x, y0: origin.y, x1: target.x, y1: target.y)\n \n        for path in ray {\n            if level[path.y][path.x].blocking {\n                lit.append(path)\n                break\n            }\n            lit.append(path)\n        }\n    }\n    return lit\n}\n```\n\nThis is a rather inefficient way in terms of complexity as it processes the same tiles over and over but in practice is fast enough. There are other more sophisticated ways of determining FoV with different permissiveness properties like shadow casting which I will explore in the future.\n\nThe code here only calculates the coordinates that fall in the FoV but doesn't do any highlighting.

I'm bound by my day job to a certain manufacturer and their software, which is not something I'm complaining about but given the choice I would probably use a Thinkpad and Linux just because I prefer the tiling window manager paradigm. This year I've been mainly using my iMac pro with 2 external monitors for a total of 3. I think this setup is great because I always have a ton of windows open at any given time and I usually need to see some bit of information in one to make progress in the other. During the first half of the year I was using a single 4k monitor with a Macbook Pro but I found that to be less efficient.\n\nI'm one of those lucky few that didn't run into any issues with the butterfly keyboards on the Mac. I think it's a pretty sweet keyboard and used it exclusively for the first half of this year. But after I switched to the iMac it was back to the good old mechanicals. The craziest thing I did this year was to get a 60% Royal Kludge keyboard. It has cherry browns -- my favorite. The user manual that came with it was pretty bad so I had a hard time understanding how to configure it properly and replaced it with something else after a while. Later this year I gave it another chance and did some experimentation to understand how the modes are supposed to work and eventually came up with a configuration I liked. It's a nice board once you get used to the missing arrow keys (macOS really helps there with the universal emacs keybindings) but it becomes difficult to use other boards once you adjust. This was reason enough for me to stop using it as I can't spend brain cycles on remembering what keyboard I'm typing with right now.\n\nI've been using the same cheap-o mouse since 2019 which is still working after a year, a nice surprise. These white label electronics usually crap out after a while. I'm not really playing 1|0 bullet anymore so the mice get to survive longer I guess. \n\n### Software\nThe majority of my time is spent in Xcode, Safari and the terminal. I use an almost vanilla bash config with git auto completion stuff that I added manually. I stated using emacs a lot more this year but haven't completely switched over from vim. The best app I've purchased this year is GoodNotes. The pencil support is so much better than Apple notes app. I started importing my PDFs into GoodNotes to use the pencil to annotate stuff. I was using Apple notes to keep my journal and notes but I decided to find a better replacement for it. The idea behind roam and the zettel kasten method lead me to org-roam. I've known for a while the power of org was legendary but never gave a serious try as it looked more like a todo list and schedule manager. But with org-roam it's very easy to take notes, link them and add images. I could not find a great way to have them sync over to my mobile devices but it's not that big of a deal. I can use a plain text editor with iCloud support to manually edit them if the needed arises. I had migrated all my journal entries to an intranet Wordpress instance but have decided to switch to org-roam's daily feature for journaling to reduce to the number of apps. I'm still in the progress of migrating them (there is a lot to migrate).\n\n### Servers\nI've been running 2 VMs and a bare metal fan-less mini PC for some time now as my home servers. These boxes hosted various dockerized services but I have decided to shutdown the box hosting the VMs. This year around May or June my Mastodon instance basically ate my Comcast quota by federating all the media attachments etc from the 15 or so Reddit and Twitter relay bots that I had setup so I decided to move Mastodon to a VPS on a provider. I got a machine with 8 cores and 16GB for 45$/month and let Mastodon run on that. I setup up a Jenkins pipeline to backup this machine and it was all good until I decided that spending that much money so that I can rant wasn't something I could justify anymore after a couple of months. So I'm shutting mastodon down and basically stepping away from posting on social media. I wasn't posting anything on corporation owned sites anyway and now that Mastodon is gone social media is going to be out of my life for good. The other services I was hosting on that machine were a bunch of TechScan related services, the local journal Wordpress and a drawio instance. I'm migrating my journals to org-roam, drawio can be replaced by Omnigraffle or GoodNotes + Apple pencil. I was also using Miniflux to read RSS but have now moved to Feedly which doesn't show me any obtrusive ads and I still get all my feeds from any device. I think that technical analysis is a sham so no need for TechScan. There's basically nothing left for the machine to host so I'm retiring it. The mini PC will still live in the new 16U server rack that I got next to my Synology NAS and TP-Link switch hosting my Gitlab instance (which is the only service that I really need at the moment).\n\n\n### What's next\nI plan on moving to a more client focused setup that still allows for synchronization over the cloud, and want to step away from using cloud apps that have access to all your data. I'm tired of the amount of maintenance that goes into hosting your own services especially from home with a wonky internet (thanks Comcast). During these quarantine times that may not seem like an issue but I don't want to get dependent on some service that I later need to carry to a VPS in a data center and pay 45$/month for it ;)\n", "file": "2020-uses-this.ipynb"}, {"title": "a simple query evaluator", "body": "\nFor a feature that I\u2019m building I needed to code up a parser that will take in a\nJSON structured query and run it against a graph of objects to get the ones that\nmatch.\n\nThe query format is similar to the MongoDB query format and looks something like\nthis:\n\n```\nlet input:[String: Any] = [\n\n\"p1\": 1,\n\n\"or\": [[\"p2\": 1], [\"and\": [ [\"p5\": 5], [\"p3\": 3]]]]\n\n]\n```\n\n\nThis means I need the nodes that have p1 property set to 1 AND either p2 set to \n1 or p5 and p3 set to 5 and 3 respectively.\n\nThe format of the query is already a AST so just need to traverse it and \nevaluate the result as we do the traversal.\n\nHere\u2019s an example node\n```\nlet model:[String: Int] = [\n\n\"p1\": 1,\n\n\"p2\": 2,\n\n\"p3\": 4,\n\n\"p5\": 5\n\n]\n```\n\n*Solution*\n\nHere\u2019s the traversal code (simplified for the article but the main idea is there)\n\n```\nfunc resolve(input: [String: Any], model: [String: Int]) -> [Bool] {\n\n return _resolve(input: input, model: model).allSatisfy { $0 }\n\n}\n\nfunc _resolve(input: [String: Any], model: [String: Int]) -> [Bool] {\n\n var results = [Bool]()\n\n for (key, value) in input {\n\n  if let value=value as?

This made me think that a class that is responsible for assigning work to these janitors of the level could be a better way to go. I also set up some code that keeps tracks of the tiles that are destroyed so I don\u2019t have to scan the whole level each turn. This architecture also requires the need for synchronization between the bots as they are racing to find a tile to repair. After some play testing I realized that assigning a wall to repair to an agent also needs some additional checks as the player may kill the bot assigned to that task and the BotMind should reassign that repair task to another bot if that happens.\n\nA funny bug I found was that when I destroyed a floor a repair bot would go there and build a wall. The reason was that I wasn\u2019t filtering based on the tile type that was destroyed and adding them all to the destroyed objects list. It was an easy fix but I did chuckle when I first saw it.\n\nI also ran into an issue where the player was aiming a bot and even though the weapon had a 100% hit chance it was missing the bot and the bot continued along it\u2019s path. I figured that the bot was being scheduled to move before the player but I was pretty certain that I had put the player as the first actor in the scheduler queue. After checking multiple places in the code I found a call from the older version of the scheduler that was shuffling the queue.\n\nI realized after watching some Cogmind videos that I wasn\u2019t labeling the bots but just the props. I dived into get section and saw that Props were embedded into the level tile data but bots weren\u2019t. So I had to given them their own labeling pass. There is an issue of overlapping labels that needs some thought on a good solution and is something that I\u2019m not really keen on doing right now. It\u2019ll have to wait in the backlog.\n\nAnother issue was in tne fog reveal. If an unexplored area was behind a prop and not in the players FOV it would not be revealed even though most of the tiles around it would. This seemed inconsistent so I switched to revealing every tile that\u2019s in the rectangle around the player within the fovRadius parameter. It\u2019s way better like this.\n\nCaching for the FOV calls was in the back of my mind for some time now so I added that. You can cache it in definitely as props and walls get blown up so they change and adding something too sophisticated that recalculates based on this seemed overkill. The simple cache just keeps the calcuted values around for a single turn as there multiple calls to this function per turn and invalidates the cache after a move in the scheduler. I didn\u2019t see a super gain in performance though as the calculations are pretty simple.\n\nA huge annoyance was the keyboard beeping after each key press because nobody was registered as a responder to the event. I spent a couple of hours a couple of days ago researching a solution for this but only got to a working one today. The trick was to override keyDown and not call the super method. Such a hacky workaround but gets the job done.\n\nI also added ammo tracking to the ranged weapon. Melee weapons don\u2019t have ammo so they are a special case. I added the ammo status to the info pane and disabled ranged targeting if none of the weapons have any ammo.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how many bugs related to clamping and out of bounds coordinates have surfaced in the last couple of days. Another on was when the roll for a ranged weapon failed a new target location selected randomly from the neighboring tiles could turn up to be a void tile and the npcs trying to navigate there would error out because a path could not be found. The fix was simple, just filter out those bad location before picking the new one.\n\nI also came across another issue where a cell that was illuminated could not be picked as a target because it was reported to not be in the LOS. Thid was happening because LOS is calculated using Bresenham and in some cases the line would need to pass through a neighboring wall tile and that was not considered to be in LOS. I solved this by changing the definition of LOS to be a cell in the FOV. With the the targeting line can sometimes appear to cross walls but that\u2019s okay.\n\n![](/img/km10.gif)\n\n", "file": "kogmind_2020-06-13.ipynb"}, {"title": "kogmind devlog #4", "body": "\nI was using a fixed seed during the development up until now for the RNG but I thought it would be a good time to start seeing how different seeds affect level generation and weapon rolls. So I started randomizing the seed for the RNG but I also log the selected seed in case I need to reproduce something.\n\nYesterday I wrote about the ranged targeting line running through walls. It was replacing the wall tiles completely and looked a bit weird so I decided to use the overlay rendering layer to render the targeting line. I also changed the background to green with some transparency so that the wall tiles can be seen. This makes for a better visual.\n\n\n![](/img/km20200615.png)\n\nWith the panning implementation the viewport updates needed to be changed and this has caused some new issues that I discovered today. When the player was alternating directions per turn (left, right, left, right,..) the viewport would update before the level rendered and produced a perception of sluggish rendering. I moved the viewport update to happen after the level rendered in the scheduler tick.\n\n![](/img/km7.gif)\n\n\nAnother annoying bug I introduced by trying to be clever and not rendering cells that are not in FoW caused some quirks. Pay attention to the corridor on the middle left (the last one before the void).

Cogmind has exceptional animations and downloaded some of the animation gifs that were in the devblog and analyzed them frame by frame to get a better idea on how to create good animations. I'll go over the animations themselves in a different section but in this doc I want to outline a system that will manage the rendering of each individual animation on the screen.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThere are going to be different kinds of animations: explosion, fire, beam weapon charging, etc. All these animation will contain the procedural logic to play the animation within it self, but there needs to be a rendering pipeline that accepts these animations and plays them in sequence. The computations of the animations need to happen in a background thread and the actual rendering needs to happen it the UI thread so we are talking about async execution. This means the pipeline needs to synchronize these animations to play in sequence. This is accomplished by using DispatchGroup and a semaphore that controls the number of animations allowed to run. A simple \u0010Animating protocol defines the interface that the pipeline will need to run any given animation.\n\n```swift\nclass AnimationPipeline {\n    var game: Game\n    var animations = [Animating]()\n    private let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 1)\n    private let dispatchQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \"taskQueue\", qos: .default)\n \n    init(game: Game) {\n        self.game = game\n    }\n    func execute() {\n        let group = DispatchGroup()\n        for a in animations {\n            group.enter()\n            self.dispatchQueue.async {\n                self.semaphore.wait()\n                a.run()\n                self.semaphore.signal()\n                group.leave()\n            }\n        }\n        group.notify(queue: DispatchQueue.main) {\n            self.game.render()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere the various components that have animations queue up all their Animating classes in and then call execute once they are ready to have the animations played. The pipeline iterates through all the animations in the queue and waits on the semaphore until the animation is completed. Once every animation has been player it clears the screen to return to the original state.\n\n\n## Update 1\nAn shortcoming that I discovered today with the pipeline was that the current animation has to finish before the next one can start and this is not always the desired effect. When you shoot a laser it's more realistic and better looking if the target starts bursting out sparks at contact rather then waiting for the beam animation to finish. This means that the architecture had to change into a model that allows creation of a chain of animations with the running animation having some means of triggering the next animation in the and continue running. I implemented this by adding an index and a closure parameter to the run function of the Animating protocol. When the pipeline calls run on the animation it passes in the current index and a reference to a method called trigger of itself. When the animation has done its initial work (e.g the beam animation has reached the target) it calls the method reference with the index parameter plus 1 indicating the next animation should start. This signal is captured by the pipeline and the animation with the index received from the current animation is added to the running queue.\nThere are other ways of accomplishing the same synchronization by using semaphores inn the pipeline but this approach seemed cleaner and totally non blocking.\n\n![](/img/km1.gif)\n![](/img/km2.gif)\n\n\n## Update 2\nI ran into an issue with the sequence of the scheduled actors and the animations. Since these two are running in different queues some of the actors were getting scheduled to move before the explosion or destruction animations were being completed. I didn't want to use a single serial queue to synchronize the animations and scheduled actions to I implemented a DispatchGroup on the AnimationPipeline to block until the animation is completed.\n\n![](/img/km11.gif)\n", "file": "animation_pipeline.ipynb"}, {"title": "roguelike fov 2", "body": "# Shadow casting\n\nI was thinking that the ray casting method above would be sufficient but I have since seen some quirks in the highlighted tiles in the FoV that made me want to ditch it. Another reason for implementing a more efficient algorithm is that the enemies and neutral characters in the level also have a field of view that will make them react to other actors, props, etc. that they can see. This meant that the FoV calculations will be triggered over and over for potentially tens to hundreds of actors per turn.\n\nShadow casting is actually a reversal in a sense that you don't try to figure out the cells that are visible but try to find the cells that are shadowed by obstacles. After some research on previous implementations I was able to grasp the logic behind the algorithm and want to go over it here with hopes to explain it better.\n\nUltimately we want to have a 360 degree FoV but breaking up the whole into 8 pieces of 45 degrees each will make it much more simpler as the algorithm is basically the same for each octant with just the increments of the rows and columns differing by octant.\n\n```\n#################f\n#.......11111...#e\n#.......1111....#d\n#.......111.....#c\n#.......11......#b\n#.......@.......#a\n#...............#\n#################\n```\n\n*the first octant marked by 1's*\n\nwe will scan each row in the octant and mark it as visible if there is no object that is cast a shadow, starting for row a working out way up to row f. You should terminate processing if the FoV radius is reached before the end of the map. So without any blocking tiles this is rather straight forward.\n\n```\nfor row in 1..<actor.fovRadius {\n for col in 0...row {\n   y = player.position.y - row\n   x = player.position.x + col\n   map[y][x] = 1\n }\n}\n```\n\nThen we need to repeat the same for the remaining 7 octants. The part that will change is the player.position.y - row and player.position.x + col. For the octant that covers [-45;0] you would want to subtract the column instead of adding it. A nice way of implementing this would be to store the increment deltas in a list and apply them based on the octant number\n\n```\nlet octants = [\n [XY(x: 0, y: -1), XY(x: 1, y: 0)],\n [XY(x: 1, y: 0), XY(x: 0, y: -1)],\n [XY(x: 1, y: 0), XY(x: 0, y: 1)],\n [XY(x: 0, y: 1), XY(x: 1, y: 0)],\n [XY(x: 0, y: 1), XY(x: -1, y: 0)],\n [XY(x: -1, y: 0), XY(x: 0, y: 1)],\n [XY(x: -1, y: 0), XY(x: 0, y: -1)],\n [XY(x: 0, y: -1), XY(x: -1, y: 0)]\n]\n```\n\nNow the increments can be accessed as\n\n```\nlet rowInc = octants[octant][0]\nlet colInc = octants[octant][1]\nand we can iterate over this list for each octant we want to process\nlet fov = (0..<8).flatMap { processOctant(actor: actor, octant: $0) }\nwith the\nprivate func processOctant(actor: Character, octant: Int) -> [XY] {\n...\n}\n```\n\nOk, so how can we calculate the shadows? The idea is to keep a list of shadow angles that are being cast from an opaque object. We'll define the angle to be a value between 0 and 1 where 0 represents 0 degrees and 1 represents 45 degrees in the first octant. This will have different values for the other octants but that's not important. We're not really dealing with the angles but the slope of the ray that touches from the top left of the obstacle and the bottom right proceeding upwards and right (for the 1st octant) that is originating from the player.\n\n\n\nHere's a zoomed in version\n\n*light rays shooting from the player*\n\nAny tile that has a projection (lights shooting from the player touch the top left and bottom right) that falls within the range of already calculated projections cannot be seen by the player. This is due to the fact that any tile further away from the player will have a narrower angle between the left and right slopes because all of the tiles are the same size and shape.\n\nCalculating the slopes for the projection is basically finding the ratio of the columns to rows of the top left and bottom right parts of the tile. By rows and columns I mean the length of the line from the player tile to the target tile.\n\n```\nprivate func getProjection(row: Int, col: Int) -> Shadow {\n    let topLeft = Double(col) / Double(row + 1)\n    let bottomRight = Double(col + 1) / Double(row)\n    return Shadow(start: topLeft, end: bottomRight)\n}\n```\n\nfor the lop left calculation the nominator is col as the player location is zero so target location - player location is just the column of the target. The denominator has 1 added to its row because the it's actually the bottom of the row above it. For the bottom right calculation we need to add 1 to the column as it's actually the corner of the next column.\n\nAs we are processing row by row we need to keep track of all the shadows (left and right slopes) to filter out tiles that fall into this range. We could keep a list of all the left/right slopes we have seen thus far and linearly search each one but there is a better way: we can actually merge any new projections that we encounter into a list of existing projections. This works like this:\n\nLet's say our shadow list is\n\n[(0...0.2), (0.6...0.7)]\n\nand we get the projection (0.8...0.9). We check out list and see that it doesn't intersect with any existing projections so we can just append it to our list. Out new list is\n\n[(0...0.2), (0.6...0.7), (0.8...0.9)].\n\nLets say our next tile has the projection [0.4...0.85]. This fits right into the middle of and covers the existing (0.6...0.7) projection entirely and also partially covers (0.8...0.9) so we can go ahead and merge. Our new list is now\n\n[(0...0.2), (0.4...0.9)]\n\nInstead of having 4 items we have 2 now that we merged. If we ever reach a state where we have only one element in the shadows list and the left slope is 0 and right slope is 1 then we have the whole octant covered and every object in the rows after this row will be covered by the shadow so we can stop processing.\n\n```\nprivate func processOctant(actor: Character, octant: Int) -> [XY] {\n    let rowInc = octants[octant][0]\n    let colInc = octants[octant][1]\n    var fullShadow = false\n    var result = [XY]()\n    shadows = [Shadow]()\n    for row in 1..<actor.fovRadius {\n        var pos = actor.location + (rowInc * row)\n        guard actor.game.scene.viewPort.contains(point: pos) else { break }\n        for col in 0...row {\n            if fullShadow {\n                continue\n            } else {\n                let projection = getProjection(row: row, col: col)\n                if !isInShadow(projection: projection) {\n                    result.append(pos)\n                }\n                if actor.game.level.map[pos.y][pos.x].blocking {\n                    fullShadow = addShadow(shadow: projection)\n                }\n            }\n            pos = pos + colInc\n            guard actor.game.scene.viewPort.contains(point: pos) else { break }\n        }\n    }\n    return result\n}\n```\n\nSo how would this merging algorithm look like? Here are the steps we need to consider\n\n1. Find out the correct index to put our new item in. It could be with or without a merge.\n2. Find if our new item overlaps with the previous entry or the next entry. We'll use this to do any necessary merges.\n3. handle the 4 conditions of\n   1. overlaps with previous and next\n   2. overlaps with next but not previous\n   3. overlaps with previous but not next\n   4. there is no overlap at all\n   5. based on the overlapping situation adjusting the start/end (left/right) slope will take care of the merging.\n\n```\nvar index = 0\n for curShadow in shadows {\n     if curShadow.start > shadow.start {\n         break\n     }\n     index += 1\n }\n //let index = shadows.firstIndex { $0.start > shadow.start } ?? shadows.count\n \n let overlapsPrev = (index > 0) && (shadows[index - 1].end > shadow.start)\n let overlapsNext = (index < shadows.count) && shadows[index].start < shadow.end\n \n if overlapsNext {\n     if overlapsPrev {\n         shadows[index - 1].end = max(shadows[index-1].end, shadows[index].end)\n         shadows.remove(at: index)\n     } else {\n         shadows[index].start = min(shadows[index].start, shadow.start)\n     }\n } else {\n     if overlapsPrev {\n         shadows[index - 1].end = max(shadows[index - 1].end, shadow.end)\n     } else {\n         shadows.insert(shadow, at: index)\n     }\n }\n```\n\nHere are 2 images of a ray casting and shadow casting to compare:\n\n\n\n\n", "file": "roguelike-fov2.ipynb"}, {"title": "kogmind: devlog #2", "body": "\nI realized today that the animation pipeline that I have doesn\u2019t support animations that need to overlap.

I cannot believe almost a whole year has gone by without us getting to dine at a nice restaurant. I'm a typical stay-at-home introvert but this is hard to believe even for me. \n\n\n### Looting\nThen struck the whole COVID madness. Scenes like this\n\n![](/img/loots.jpg)\n\nbecame the norm throughout the country. Luckily for us we never got in a dire situation because of the hoarding that people were doing. It's crazy that people act the way that they do when they are panicking but I think the intervention from the authorities (e.g super markets) came too late. They should have started limiting purchases of certain items a lot sooner. Not strictly limiting, e.g keeping track but discouraging people from buying more than they need. I think Costco made a great move by saying they are not going to accept returns for toilet papers. \n\n\n### Day care issues\n\nThe impact of COVID is felt by all and I think we were extremely lucky to not contract a virus and were minimally affected by the changes caused by the virus. The most significant changes in our lives were that we started working from home and that our daughter had to start at a different day care. Ironically the new day care she started was the day care that we had considered and decided against last year. The main reasons we decided against it was that it was farther away from where we lived, they didn't provide diapers and my wife thought it was an inconvenience she wasn't willing to put up with and it was 30% more expensive. Well after COVID hit our original day care (which is sister schools with this day care) said that attendance was not enough to justify keeping the school open and that their corporate HQ decided to merge schools in the region. Unfortunately we can't afford not to send our kid to school because we both work and it's just impossible to have her around the house and get any work done. I really do feel for the families that are in this situation due to school shutdowns and wish them all the strength in the world so that they can maintain their sanity. Anyways this change in day care turned out to be a good change. The new place had a much better program with more engagement and more STEM oriented curriculum (yes day cares have  a curriculum). The updates and reports that the teachers were providing via the app were very detailed and she has learned so much after she started here. After some time the old day care announced through the app that they were reopening but we decided to keep her at the new care permanently. \n\n\n\n### A forgotten drink\n\nI made my first \"Churchill\" drink since moving to the US.\n\n![](/img/curcil.jpg)\n\nThis is a simple cocktail made from mineral water, lemon juice and salt. The reason this is important is that the mineral water I got from a Middle Eastern market sat there in the fridge for months and months before I actually remembered to make this drink (which I actually like quite a lot) and became a symbol of my procastination.\n\n### A new house\n\nI guess the biggest change for this year is that we bought a house. Buying a house in Seattle, WA is a very long and tedious process. We actually started our search in fall 2019 but actually managed to buy a house in June 2020. \n\nThe house is in a great neighborhood ideal for a toddler. We even have a play set in the back yard so I guess she's a lucky kiddo. \n\nThe house was built in the early 90s and the interior reflected that era with it's oak heavy cabinetry so a remodeling was needed. We decided to go with a small family business that our Realtor recommended and they did a pretty good job, albeit at an extra cost. I was very impressed with the work ethic that contractors have here. When they say they are going to be there at Xpm they are actually there at that time. I've seen all sorts of inexcusable behavior such as being hours late to not showing up at all in a previous life, so this was good experience. \n\nMoving is never fun. Moving from an apartment to a house was manageable but moving from a house to a new house was very very exhausting. It's incredible to amount of crap you accumulate through the years. \n\n![](/img/packing.jpeg)\n*packing at the end of the first day. 3 more days of packing followed*\n\n\n### A blind test\n\nI have always come across people who claim that they can tell the difference between Coke Zero and Diet Coke. I personally think it's not possible as the difference is very subtle (if it even exists). One of these people was my wife. So I put her to the test. Here's the setup:\nThere are 5 glasses with coke in them. Find the ones that are Diet Coke. Pretty simple, 1/32 chance of guessing correctly which is good enough to rule that out. So we did the test. She scored 3 out of 5 and declared her self a winner. I guess it's my fault that I didn't explain before the test that she would have to do 100%. I mean, I can tell the difference between coke and water and I would score 100% every time I took such a test so it seemed pretty evident to me that only a full score would pass. But apparently she has a different idea.\n\n![](/img/coketest.jpeg)\n\n### Worst weeks\n\nI think 2020 has been a year that is going to be memorable for the bad things that happened. The COVID situation is the most obvious one but it doesn't stop there for me. Our daughter dislocated (or broke can't be sure because it was a hidden fracture) her elbow this year. She had her arm in a cast for 2 weeks. This is not super critical but all this happened after 2 weeks of day care shutdown on the day it was opening back. Having her home all that time was very challenging to say the least. As if all this wasn't enough a cherry tree in the neighbors yard broke and fell on the play set in our yard. Luckily there were no injuries. \n\n![](/img/tree.jpeg)\n\n### Best buy of 2020\n\nI had to buy a lot of tools for the new house this year. I think the best piece I got this year is the Sun Joe pressure washer. It's very satisfying to see that grime being removed. \n\n![](/img/sunjoe.gif)\n\nI did not get any electronics this year. There is simply nothing worth buying that will provide a trace of utility in my life. So the best buy has to go to my new server rack and the switch (the computers I already had.)\n\n![](/img/serverrack.jpeg)\n\n\nAnother big purchase this year was a car. I was having back pain putting our kid into the car seat in the back everyday and we needed something with a larger cargo capacity to haul things for the back yard and the house from Home Depot so we got an 7 seater SUV.\n\n\n\n### Future\n\nThis was a weird and unusual year indeed and I think the old normal will not be the normal. Things in all aspects of life are going to change and adapt to the new findings caused by the events of 2020. \n\nHere's a piece of play-doh art that summarizes 2020\n\n![](/img/playdoh2020.jpeg)\n", "file": "2020-summary.ipynb"}, {"title": "hello world", "body": "\nHello world from a new version of Hugo.

Another method is to space out rooms until non are overlapping and discard any rooms that have \"fallen off\" the edge of the map.\n\n*method 1 - discard overlapping rooms*\n\n```\nfor _ in 0...maxRooms {\n    let w = Int.random(in: minRoomSize...maxRoomSize)\n    let h = Int.random(in: minRoomSize...maxRoomSize)\n    let x = Int.random(in: 0..<cols - w)\n    let y = Int.random(in: 0..<rows - h)\n    let newRoom = Room(id: roomId, xy: XY(x: x, y: y), wh: WH(w: w, h: h))\n    roomId += 1\n    let failed = rooms.contains { newRoom.intersects(other: $0) }\n    if !failed {\n        renderer.drawBox(x: x, y: y, w: w, h: h)\n        rooms.append(newRoom)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n*method 2 - push out rooms until they don't intersect anymore*\n\n```\nvar touching = true\nwhile touching {\n    touching = false\n    for i in 0..<numRooms {\n        for j in (i+1)..<numRooms {\n            let a = cells[i]\n            let b = cells[j]\n            if a.intersects(other: b) {\n                touching = true\n                var dx = min(a.bottomRight.x - b.topLeft.x + padding, a.topLeft.x - b.bottomRight.x - padding)\n                var dy = min(a.bottomRight.y - b.topLeft.y + padding, a.topLeft.y - b.bottomRight.y - padding)\n                if abs(dx) < abs(dy) {\n                    dy = 0\n                } else {\n                    dx = 0\n                }\n                let dxa = Int(-dx / 2)\n                let dxb = dx + dxa\n                let dya = Int(-dy / 2)\n                let dyb = dy + dya\n                a.shift(dv: XY(x: dxa, y: dya))\n                b.shift(dv: XY(x: dxb, y: dyb))\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Room connection\n\nConnecting rooms can be done by connecting the current room with the one before it. You can have a X% chance of initiating the connection from the top of the room or the side of the room to add some flavor. This method guarantees that the dungeon is fully connected and usually as the number of rooms increase you get a cyclic connection structure which is more interesting than a non-cyclic structure. Using this method can lead to a direct connection from the start room to the end room. There are checks that could be implemented to mitigate this and the game mechanics may also give incentive to exploration to make this a non-issue. I call this the \u201cn-1\u201d connection/tunneler method.\n\n\n```\nif !failed {\n    renderer.drawBox(x: x, y: y, w: w, h: h)\n    let newX = newRoom.centerX\n    let newY = newRoom.centerY\n    if rooms.count != 0 {\n        let prevX = rooms.last!.centerX\n        let prevY = rooms.last!.centerY\n        if Int.random(in: 0...10) < 5 {\n            horTunnels.append((x0: prevX, x1: newX, y0: prevY))\n            vertTunnels.append((y0: prevY, y1: newY, x0: newX))\n        } else {\n            vertTunnels.append((y0: prevY, y1: newY, x0: prevX))\n            horTunnels.append((x0: prevX, x1: newX, y0: newY))\n        }\n    }\n    rooms.append(newRoom)\n}\n```\n\nThe example code just stores the coordinates of the halls that are created and doesn't store the connection graph but that pretty trivial to implement but it's not needed as the level map provides this data after the tiles are laid on the map.\n\nAnother method of connecting the rooms is to use Relative Neighborhood Graphs. This is a subgraph of the Delauny Triangulation and tries to connect rooms that appear to be close and produce nice results. If this type of graph feels to strongly connected creating a MST for the rooms and then selectively adding X% percent of the RNG connections that may also yield good results.\n\n\n## Halls\n\nThe connecting halls them selves can either be straight, L shaped or meandering like a maze. Maze algorithms may lead to dead ends which may not be desirable but can easily be pruned (just remove any hall tile that surrounded by at least 3 empty tiles).\n\n*a map generated by random intersecting prune placement and n-1 tunneling*\n\n![img_bad7f5982307-1.jpeg](/img/a.jpeg)\n\nanother map generated by the same algorithm as above (someone else wrote this, I saw their post on reddit in /r/roguelikedev but can't find it anymore so I can't properly credit them)\n\n![1.png](/img/b.png)\n\n\nBSP made room placement with n-1 connection\n\n![2.png](/img/c.png)\n\nMaze based tunnelling\n\n![screen_shot_2020-05-23_at_10.29.49_pm.png](/img/d.png)\n\n", "file": "dungeon-generation-revisited.ipynb"}, {"title": "my backup strategy", "body": "\nI've always backuped my files and folders for as long as I can remember. But up until a couple of months ago my backup strategy was ad-hoc. I would manually copy important files to a networked computer, cloud storage or before those existed to a USB drive. It was mostly not automated or very poorly automated by a couple of lines of bash scripts creating zip/tar.gz archives of directories and copying them over. This is kind of works but is very inefficient and not really sustainable as the data you need to backup accumulates over time. So about 2-3 months ago I decided to invest the time to look into some existing solutions in this area. My requirements were pretty simple:\n\n- Support incremental backups\n- Support encrypted backups\n- Support for sending backups to another machine on the network\n- Easy to configure a new directory to backup\n- CLI driven\n\nAfter some research the simplest program that would support all these requirements seemed to be Borg backup. I paired Borg with Jenkins for scheduled backups and a Synology NAS with CloudSync for off-site encrypted backups on the cloud. \n\nThe process is pretty simple.\n\n### Initial setup\n\nThere are 2 types of backups for me:\n\n  1. Backups of files that I only need to keep on-site\n  2. Backups of files that are super important and need to be backed up on the cloud (encrypted)\n\nDifferent projects may live on different servers on the network and each host on the network gets it's own Borg repository. The initial repo setup is done manually but it's not really worth automating this as I haven' added a new machine to the network in ages (I don't think I've added a new machine after I started using Borg)\n\n### Backup process\n\nI use Jenkins to schedule the backups, so each app/data store gets its own backup job in Jenkins. \n\n![jenkins](/img/jenkins-backup-jobs.png)\n\nScripting Borg commands via the Shell execution block in Jenkins makes everything pretty simple:\n\n```\nNFS_MOUNTS=$(mount -l | grep nfs | wc -l)\nif [ $NFS_MOUNTS -eq 0 ]; then\n echo \"NFS not mounted\"\n return -1\nfi\n\nsudo BORG_PASSPHRASE=<password> borg create -v --stats --compression zlib /mnt/backup/cloud-synced/borg-s1::ctp-data-{now} /tmp/ctp-data/\n\n```\n\nBorg doesn't support putting stuff on a networked machine natively but that's not really a blocker. I just mount a directory on the NAS to all the hosts. The first couple of lines in the script checks that the NAS is mounted or fails. The next line is borg command that doest the backups. There are 2 directories on the NAS \n  \n  1. The `unsynced` directory\n  2. The `cloud-synced` directory\n  \nI've setup Synology CloudSync to send the files in the `cloud-synced` directory over to a cloud hosting provider. \n\nI also use some plugins in Jenkins to coordinate the backup process. Some app that I host like the wiki require frequent backups and sometimes depending on system load the duration of the backup may exceed the frequency. I also don't want multiple Borg jobs writing to the same repository as this may lead to race conditions. So I use the Lockable Resources plugin in Jenkins to synchronize these jobs. \n  \nThere are multiple hosts that need backups so I need a Jenkins runner on each host that has access to the directories on that machine so I also need a plugin that makes sure that a job can only run on a host that I specify. \n  \nThis works pretty well for data that's residing on my servers but for files on laptops etc it's not really convenient. I still copy documents and files manually from client to the NAS when I want to keep a backup of those. But as I'm moving my apps to self hosted web app based solutions I find that the need to do this manual copying is pretty minimal.\n", "file": "backup-strategy.ipynb"}, {"title": "tracking hydration (for free)", "body": "\nLately I've been into calorie counting and water consumption tracking. I'm using the MyNetDiary app for the calorie tracking but I hadn't been able to find a free app that's good for water tracking.

That's a lot of steps. This is where the ShortCuts app comes in very handy. I found a shortcut called \"Log water\" (or found it in the gallery, I don't recall exactly as I had been playing around with this a long time ago) and modified it to show the sizes of the glasses I use the most. Then I added the short cut to my home screen, and that's it. I still use the app I mentioned to get the push notifications to remind me to drink, but at least I'm not seeing any ads.

From documentation for his business to blog posts. The reason I find this a really cool idea is that you can include runnable in a post with it's output formatted as data frames or a mathplotlib graph. Jupyter is pretty flexible in the way it will allow you to produce output so you can go pretty wild like rendering your own SVG's etc.\n\n\n### Migration from hugo\n\nI had been using hugo for a while now and everything I wrote was in markdown and Jupyter has built-in support for markdown. The only thing I needed to do was write a small python script that would embed the markdown files from hugo into jupyter notebooks (which are JSON and easy to understand). The only tricky part here was that hugo uses front matter to keep the metadata for posts while jupyter doesn't have such a feature. I ended up with creating a raw cell that holds this metadata and the second cell is the markdown cell that has the content.\n\n\n\n### Notebook to HTML\n\nI had a couple of different options for generating the HTML from notebooks. \n\n- Use the built-in HTML generation.\n- Get the markdown and export it to hugo or another markdown parser for the HTML\n- Use a different notebook viewer\n\nThe built-in HTML generation is the easiest and most straight forward option but the resulting HTML was huge. A notebook with no image attachments was around 575Kb. I took a look at the templating system to see if I could optimize it but there was a lot of css compiled into the page and it looked pretty complicated so I didn't want to invest too much time into exploring this.\n\nThe markdown export was also a good idea but the main issue with this approach was processing the attachments. I tried a tool called `nbdev` which exports all the attachments to files but the links in the markdown document were not converted to the proper URL. It could be working for inline image generated by code cells but it will not work for attached images. \n\nI also considered writing a script to extract the attachments and update the markdown links myself but that's also a lot of work and I would also have manage all the different cell types etc. \n\nThen I explored the route of in-browser rendering. And not surprisingly there is a project called `notebook.js` which renders the notebook given the `ipynb` source. I ended up choosing this project and embedding the source file into the HTML.\n\n\n### Index page generation\n\nThere is no \"index page\" in the world of jupyter notebooks. You get a file explorer like interface and you choose your notebook. I needed something that displays the title, description and tags of the articles in a list. So I put together a script that traverses the notebooks and extracts the metadata from the first cell to create the index page. \n\n### Tag pages and menu\n\nOne of the great features of the hugo theme I was using before was the tag pages. But I couldn't be bothered to modify the theme to support a navigation bar with the tags. So I implemented both these features in the script I wrote for the notebook extractor. \n\n\n### Microblog imap\n\nI recently shutdown my mastodon server because I could not justify paying 50$ for a server each month. But I don't like to post the occasional micro update and using a notebook for a short update is not practical. So I created a script that will monitor my email account for a certain email format and use it to create a new notebook with the content and publish it to the micro section on my website.\n\n### Search\n\nSearch is always complicated with static sites. When there is no server side code to power the search it stops making sense to create a reverse lookup index. So the method I came up with is to create the a mapping of the source for the posts to the file names and store that as JSON data to be processed by the client. So when you go to the search page you are basically downloading the entire text content of the posts in a single huge JSON along with the lemmatizations of the tokens in the body. Something like this\n\n```json\n\n{\n...\n\"implement\": [\"implemented\", \"implements\", \"implementing\"], \n\"pay\": [\"paying\", \"pays\", \"paid\"]\n...\n}\n\n```\n\nThen lemmatizing the input query to get the extended versions of the term and running a search for all these terms seems to yield good results and is fast enough. E.g if you were to search for \"paid\" the process would get the stem as \"pay\" then augment the search to include \"paying\", \"pays\", \"paid\" and return all the docs that contain these words too.\n\n\nThe ordering of the search results is something that needs more work but the there aren't that many documents to it's not that big of a deal.\n\n\nHaving a powerful environment that can evaluate and execute code will be great for technical writing!\nfor i in range(3):\n    print(\"More power!\")", "file": "jupyter-notebook-blogging.ipynb"}, {"title": "book review: procedural generation in game design", "body": "\nI\u2019ve been looking into rogue like games and the generation of levels done \nusing procedural generation is something that I found to be interesting. \nA book on the subject edited by the creator of dwarf fortress look like a \ngood read so I got it from Amazon on May 28, 2020 for 50$ as a hard copy. \nThe book is a compilation of articles ranging from some what procedural \ngeneration is and isn\u2019t to the ethics in the output of the generated content.\nIt\u2019s an interesting read though nothing that is too enlightening.\n\nThere is only one chapter that provides some pseudo-code about the idea but the\nrest of the chapters are more around discussions and ideas in PCG.

You don't have a server side component that will execute the search so you either need to have an external search engine index your site or you need to have the client perform the search on an index that you provide for download. Having an external search engine index needs your site to provide the HTML for crawler requests and web application don't usually work well with this. You should probably have a fully rendered version of your site for SEO purposes but I'm not about SEO. So I went ahead and wrote a mini search engine for this purpose. \n\nSo when exporting the content from the source (it could be a markdown source etc.) the script also needs to generate the search index. The most basic structure for this index could a JSON file that contains the document URL mapped to it's content.\n\ndocs = {\n    \"file1.html\": \"this is some document with text. Crime never pays.\",\n    \"file2.html\": \"this is another document. If crime paid things would be different.\"\n}\ndocsJust this would be enough to whip up a Javascript grep engine. But just grepping isn't a great search experience. You need to enhance the search engine with some language understanding to get better results. So for example in our 2 documents a search for \"pays\" would only result in document 1 if we were grepping. But document 2 actually also contains relevant information. The best way to capture this type of language understanding is to add lemmatization to the index.\n\nFirst step in this process is to tokenize the input. I'm using the python `nltk` package for all the NLP stuff.from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.stem.wordnet import WordNetLemmatizer\n\nlem = WordNetLemmatizer()\nstop_words = set(stopwords.words(\"english\"))\nwords = []\nfor k, v in docs.items():\n    words += word_tokenize(v)\nwordsThere are duplicates, stop words and mixed case words in the result list, so let's clean it up.words = [w.lower() for w in words if w not in stop_words]\nwordsThat's better. Now we'll need a map to store the root (lemma) of the word and it's versions that were present in the text. On the client side we'll use this map to enhance our search. lemma_map = {}\nfor w in words:\n    if w in lemma_map: continue\n    lemmas = list(set([lem.lemmatize(w, mode) for mode in list(\"avsn\")]))\n    if w in lemmas:\n        lemmas.remove(w)\n    if len(lemmas) == 1 and lemmas[0] == w: continue\n    for lemma in lemmas:\n        if lemma not in lemma_map:\n            lemma_map[lemma] = []\n        if w not in lemma_map[lemma]:\n            lemma_map[lemma].append(w)\nlemma_mapNow we have the ability to enhance our search on the client side to include both \"pays\" and \"paid\" for the query. How is that going to work? We are going to lemmatize the input query. So if the user were to search for \"paying\" the root would be \"pay\" and we would search for \"paid\", \"pay\", \"paying\", \"pays\". Why not just lemmatize the whole body and just send that as the index file to the client? Well we want to highlight and show a snippet of the document to the user for the search results and we can't show that from the lemmatized version of the document body, so the original document needs to be in the client. There is a trade-off between the index size and the amount of processing the client has to do and the time it takes for the results to render. In my experiments I tried pushing the lemmatization process on the client using the same WordNet lemmatizer for JavaScript and the results were pretty bad. On a i9 Macbook Pro it took around 5 seconds to render the page (this doesn't not include the network time spent downloading the index).\n\nOn the client we lemmatize the search query and add the results to a list of extended search terms. Then for each of these terms we look up more terms from the `lemma_map`search_term = \"paying\"\nextended_terms = list(set([lem.lemmatize(search_term, mode) for mode in list(\"avsn\")]))\nfor w in extended_terms:\n    if w in lemma_map:\n        extended_terms += lemma_map[w]\nextended_termsWhat's left is now to search through the contents of the documents for each of these terms.for file, body in docs.items():\n    for t in extended_terms:\n        if t in body.lower():\n            print(\"found \", file, \"for term\",t)There is some duplicate detection and search term highlighting that's also done on the client but it's not integral to the way the search index is built, so I won't be going into those details.", "file": "client_side_search.ipynb"}, {"title": "consumption 2021/02", "body": "\n## AirPods Max: An Audiophile Review\nAn article that goes deep into what the AirPod Max has to offer - from the perspective of someone who has been in the industry for a decade.

After about 75 miles there is minimal ware and tear on the sole even though I do mixed road and trail jogging.![side-opt.png](attachment:side-opt.png)![top-opt.png](attachment:top-opt.png)", "file": "brooks_ghost13_review.ipynb"}, {"title": "techscan devlog 2021-03-02", "body": "\n\nOk, more work tonight went into improving the data synchronizer. I thought it would make sense to precompute the resampled values for tickers instead of computing them on-the-fly for an indicator because the most common resampled periods are known beforehand.  Pandas provides a convenient resampling function that supports aggregation to OHLC. I had always used the closing value of the most granular period when resampling say a 1 day OHLC to 1 week. But today I found out that using the following configuration makes much more sense\n\n```\n+        config = {'open': 'first',\n+            'high': 'max',\n+            'low': 'min',\n+            'close': 'last',\n+            \"volume\": \"sum\"\n+        }\n```\n\nI also refactored some of the persistence layer code and added support for providing the sample rate when saving CSV files. On the topic of CSV files I had to combat my way through DataFrames because of my ignorance. I was manually assigning the date field as the index when loading the CSV but there is a convenience method in the API that can make the reader parse the dates and also specify an index column. That\u2019s neat. But then I had some other bugs when merging the data frame from the existing file with any new data from the APIs. Took a while to figure out exactly what was happening but got it working in the end. \n\nI also was plagued by bugs in Pandas DataReader. When I make a request that starts on current day and ends some date in the future the return data contains a duplicate.\n\n\n![Screen%20Shot%202021-03-06%20at%202.52.53%20PM.png](attachment:Screen%20Shot%202021-03-06%20at%202.52.53%20PM.png)\n\nTook a while to narrow this down but having a Jupyter notebook came in handy. So to fix this I decided to make sure the end date is always on the us/eastern time zone and if the last row\u2019s date is the same as the end date, no request needs to be made. This should prune any unnecessary requests and avoid this pandas bug.\n\nAnd last item for today was the implementing the data loader. This class will allow the backtester and signal generator to load the ticker data for a given date. The tricky part here was that weekends and holidays don\u2019t exist in the index. So any request made with that date should return the data up to that date. This can be done easily with a binary search to get the insertion index and then calculate the slice of the data frame to return. \n\n", "file": "techscan_devlog_2021-03-02.ipynb"}, {"title": "checkmate heat map", "body": "This is a small experiment on a visualization of the squares that had the most check mates delivered on. The dataset is from lichess and not filtered on rating. I guess that the most check mates would happen at the castled position at amateur level of play and the heat map confirms that.\n\nFirst off we need to do some pre-processing for our PGN files. This is not strictly necessary as you can use the excellent python-chess module to parse them but it's a lot faster if we turn it into a pattern matching problem rather that parsing the the whole game. We will use the `pgn-extract` utility for this processing step:\n\n```\n!pgn-extract --dropply -1 -V -C -N -F --notags --nomovenumbers -s --linelength 10000 -M lichess_db_standard_rated_2016-09.pgn > matefen\n```\n\nThe idea here is to goto the final position of the game `--dropply -1`, suppress unnecessary output `--notags --nomovenumbers -V -C -N -s`, output a FEN string `-F`, make sure everything is on one line (for easier processing) `--linelength 10000` and only export games that ended in a checkmate `-M`.\n\nDepending on your machine and the number of games you are processing this command could take a while. After it's complete you should have a file like this\n\n```\ndendiz@minipc-GN41:~/tmp$ head matefen\nQa7# { \"8/q7/8/8/8/8/K1k5/8 w - - 16 69\" } 0-1\n\nQdd1# { \"1k6/8/pp6/8/P2p4/8/2q5/3q2K1 w - - 4 52\" } 0-1\n\nRd8# { \"3r3K/4q2p/6pk/5p2/8/8/8/8 w - - 15 70\" } 0-1\n\nQxg7# { \"rn3rk1/1p3pQp/p2q4/2pPp3/4N3/7P/PP1K4/R5R1 b - - 0 25\" } 1-0\n\nQxc1# { \"1kr5/1p4b1/p2p2b1/3Pp1N1/4P3/1P1B1P2/P6Q/1Kq5 w - - 0 33\" } 0-1\n```\n\nThe next step is to get rid of the extra bits.\n\n```\ncat matefen | cut -d'{' -f2| cut -d'}' -f1 | tr -d '\"' |cut -d' ' -f2,3 | grep \"\\S\" > slim-mate.fen\n```\n\nWhat happens here if that we cut between the `{}` to get the FEN, then remove the `\"`, then split again on a space and get the second and third columns. Then we get rid of the extra empty lines (You could also chain all of these commands together if you wanted).\n\nAfter this step the file we have is\n\n```\ndendiz@minipc-GN41:~/app/jupyterhub/notebooks/Blog/files$ head slim-mate.fen\n8/q7/8/8/8/8/K1k5/8 w\n1k6/8/pp6/8/P2p4/8/2q5/3q2K1 w\n3r3K/4q2p/6pk/5p2/8/8/8/8 w\nrn3rk1/1p3pQp/p2q4/2pPp3/4N3/7P/PP1K4/R5R1 b\n```\n\nThis contains all the information we need (the side being checkmated and the state of the board) to start building a histogram of the squares the kings were checkmated. import chess.pgn\nimport chess\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport math\nwith open(\"slim-mate.fen\",\"r\") as infile:\n    cols = list(\"abcdefgh\")\n    crows = list(\"87654321\")\n    histo = [0] * 64\n    \n    lines = infile.read().splitlines()\n    for line in lines[:1000000]:\n        king = \"K\" if line[-1] == \"w\" else \"k\"\n        ## line is\n        ## 1k6/8/pp6/8/P2p4/8/2q5/3q2K1 w\n        fen = line[:-2]\n        rows = fen.split(\"/\")\n        for idx, row in enumerate(rows):\n            if king in row:\n                col = 0\n                for c in row:\n                    if c.isnumeric():\n                        col += int(c)\n                    elif c == king:\n                        hist_idx = 8 * idx + col\n                        histo[hist_idx] += 1\n                    else:\n                        col += 1\n\n                        \n## normalize the values for the heat map\nmaxl = max(histo)\nhisto = [x/maxl for x in histo]\nhisto = [math.floor(100*x)/100 for x in histo]\n\n## create 8x8 matrix from the flat list\nb = [histo[n:n+8] for n in range(0, len(histo), 8)]\nb.reverse()\nb = np.array(b)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.set_xticks(np.arange(8))\nax.set_yticks(np.arange(8))\nax.set_xticklabels(cols)\nax.set_yticklabels(crows)\nim = ax.imshow(b)\nfor i in range(8):\n    for j in range(8):\n        text = ax.text(j, i, b[i, j],\n                       ha=\"center\", va=\"center\", color=\"w\")\nfig.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n", "file": "checkmate_square_distribution.ipynb"}, {"title": "techscan devlog 2021-03-01", "body": "So it's been a while since I had a look into my TechScan project.

I have completed the move of all my writings on my blog to Jupyter and wrote a publishing scripting (again in a Jupyter notebook) that even has a client side search engine. \n\nThe next thing to do (pun intended) was to move my to-do lists to Jupyter. For this I thought that I would have a single notebook (called very imaginatively `todo.ipynb`) and that every cell in the note book would represent something that I wanted to do. This is OK until you want to check off an item. I thought I'd just delete the completed items but I don't like throwing away things I spent time writing so I wanted a way to mark them as complete, then eventually move to an archive so they don't clutter the main notebook. The best way I could think of this was to add `todo` tag to the item. If the items is pending it has the `todo` tag if it's not then it's done. I might actually convert this to be the other way around where if the item does not have a tag it's a `todo` and then add a `done` tag when it's done. The reason for this is that it's easy to forget to add the tag when you add a new item. \n\n\n![todolist-fs8.png](attachment:todolist-fs8.png)\n\nThis tagging method makes it kind of OK to work with items but there is still a lot of clutter because completed items are intertwined with pending items. I was using the down and up arrow to move the cells but that's a lot of clicking when you have a lot of to-do items and there is no \"send to bottom\" button. So I wrote a small script that does this for me. It traverses the notebook and moves cells with no `todo` tag to the end of the list, adds a `done` tag (which is used by the archiving script) and also adds a green text to indicate that it's done. Guess what that text reads? Yes, \"done\". \n\nThe script can the triggered from a python cell in the to-do notebook which is convenient but requires a reload because it modifies the notebook. \n\nI also have a script that I added as a scheduled job that moves the completed items in the to-do notebook to an archive notebook once a week to reduce clutter. The archive notebooks are per month.\n\nIt's not always easy to add an item to your list when you are not in front of a computer or not at home (I don't open my homelab to the outside world) so I added another script that monitors an email  account and creates to-do items from the email.", "file": "jupyter_as_todo_list.ipynb"}, {"title": "consumption 01/2021", "body": "\n## Investing legend James Simon's record won't be beat\n\nA nice article on how Renaissance technologies beat the market and the strategies they used to keep\nthe competitive advantage.

This year she has graduated and has accepted a job offer from a Seattle company and we made the move to Seattle beginning of June after having my parents and the in-laws visit us in Pittsburgh for 10 days (lots of great places seen during their visit for 10 days, but that\u2019s a whole different story). The plan before moving here was to stay at a hotel for a week while we were apartment hunting. I went online to booking.com to find a hotel. Hotels in Seattle are quite expensive since we wanted to stay near residential areas close to down town because our car wouldn\u2019t arrive until a couple of days in. I found the best solution was to rent an \u201capartel\u201d from Ginosi. This is basically a 1 bedroom apartment in a building. After a 7 hour flight from Pittsburgh when we arrived at the apartel and let our selves in we were pleasantly surprised as it only had 10 reviews on booking.com but a high rating. The place was called \u201cPuget Indigo\u201d and was located at 4th Ave. and Republican West. We arrived late sunday evening so just had to go straight to the apartment with 4 huge pieces of luggage and 3 backpacks and just call it a day. The next was memorial day so all the leasing offices were closed. We spent the day on zillow.com looking for places and reading reviews and social statistics about different neighborhoods like Queen Anne, Ballard, Belltown etc. We decided to assign a day for each neighborhood and Tuesday was Queen Anne day. We had heard good things about this place so it was a priority . B. made an excel sheet with all the places we wanted to see in Queen Anne (roughly 8 places) that matched our criteria. So the first place turned out to be an apartment in the building we were staying at! That was quite funny because we just took the elevator 2 floors down to meet the leasing specialist which took us back to the 4th floor and showed us the place. The location of the building was OK but there were renovations going on at the building and it was the first place we saw so we didn\u2019t really have anything to compare with. The next place we went to see was a condo in upper Queen Anne. The apartment was located on a very nice street with lots of houses with gardens, very residential. But you had to take 2 flights of stairs to reach the building entrance, and 2 more to reach the apartment. This was something I didn\u2019t like having lived at places like that for years. The apartment was small and the bathrooms were old  \u2013- no go.\n\nThe next place was Tarmigan located at 14th Ave W and W Boston St. This was a 2 bedroom loft with a huge volume due to high ceilings and all but it was old and the appliances looked like they were from the 80\u2019s. The best thing to do with that place would be to buy, tear it down and rebuild it.\n\nNext up was Metro on First located at John St. and 1st Ave. W. The building looked very nice from the outside with julliet patios and architecture resemblant of European style. The main entrance has a small fountain outside and a small garden. I loved how the building looked from the outside. We met with the leasing specialist and she showed us the apartment. It was great! 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms. A living room with a great view!\n\nimage\n\nJust for the sake of being the devils advocate I insisted that we see a couple of more places after we saw this apartment even though I really liked it. It was around 3pm and our next appointment was at 7 pm so we went back to the hotel to plan the next day.  10 minutes after we started look at houses in Belltown I said \u201cthis is useless, I really liked Metro on First.

I would have assumed that these shows consist of fabricated scenarios that are setup on purpose to introduce conflict and drama, so the show will sell. I was not disappointed.\n\nThe basics of the show are that you have 25 women competing for the \"love\" of one man. Why would anybody want to participate in this to find love, that I cannot understand. The chances of getting a proposal seem rather slim, and even if you do, the chances of a marriage that would last is even slimmer. The show aired 17 seasons (excluding the sister show - the bachelorette) and of these 17 couples only 1 has made it this far. So that's 5% success rate if you are a winner. Each season has 25 contestants which means that out of the 425 women, only 1 made it. Those are rather slim chances considering the humiliation and suffering after rejection that you will have to face when you are eliminated, plus the drama, conflict and the stress that you will have to endure during the season. But still the public demands this show otherwise it would not have aired for 17 seasons.\n\nWhat is interesting is how the producers of this show manipulate the contestant and how these women still want to participate knowing that they are very likely to end up with a broken heart and hurt feelings. First of all the bachelor candidate is very above the average guy you would see around. Physical attraction and basic primitives are at work here. The producers also super charge this man with extremities that a regular person would not be able to deliver such as luxury dates in exotic location (a dinner in Thailand), abnormal ways of transportation (elephant back riding through the rain forest), etc. which adds to the admiration that the women build up for this man. What the women fail to realize (or they never mention it) is that these are all setup by the producers of the show and will end after the season, and they will probably be going back to eating cheap take outs.\n\nAnother way to impose a bonding process (which is required so that the show will continue) is that they let the bachelor guide the women through a frightening experience, which would make the woman believe the bachelor is their hero. It is fairly simple for an isolated person, who is living away from the normal routine of their lives, to get confused by such an overwhelming exposure to raw emotions. The setup for this would include I believe an elicitation process done by the casting crew before the show is shot where the women would talk about their phobias or traumatic experiences. Once these are known it is fairly simple for the producers to setup scenarios where the bachelor can save the women from a plot that was fabricated by the producers in the first place. These ploys also exploit the fact that people are confused by the source of excitement during an adrenalin rush. They can't distinguish between cause of this sense. Is the source the event or the person that they are together with during this event. This type of bonding where the person would mistake physical safety for emotional safety would open the path for the person to trust the other person and to share traumas and other intimate secrets. Why on earth otherwise would you share such personal information with some one you only know for a couple of week and maybe spent only a few hours together? To amplify these effects the candidates are taken away from their daily lives and from the people that they know and trust that would normally contribute thoughts about this relationship. On the episodes that I watched where the guy goes to meet the family, nearly all of the families were skeptical about the process and the show, and they were right. This is because they are not caught in the race, and they are not manipulated. The same is true for women meeting the guys family. They are not in isolation and have a better perspective on the whole situation. But ultimately they all say \"it's your choice.\". It's no wonder that the women are thinking that this guy is \"the one\" for them, because the producers are using the scarcity principle to elevate the value of the bachelor. The women only have a limited time with the guy, and they are pressured to make most of that time and therefore agree to doing all sorts of crazy stuff - like eating fried bugs - that they might normally prefer not to do. They also get caught in the heat of the competition.\n\nThe producers select a mix of personalities that are likely to produce the most drama, and once the women assume a role, a persona for themselves they stick with it. This is comparable to the Stanford prison experiment conducted by Zimbardo, in which the inmates would comply with the request that were made by the guardians, even though they didn't have to. They chose instinctively to stick to their personas. These personas are usually stereotypical like the bitchy one, and the brave one who will confront the bitchy one, and the naive one who really is only seeking true love.\n\nI would say that seeking true love by participating in a TV show is total non-sense. The way that this is marketed as a means of helping people find love is also an insult. But never the less it was fun to watch a few episodes and enlightening to analyze the way that TV show producers are using psychological games to drive a business.\n", "file": "mechanics_bachelor.ipynb"}, {"title": "installing php pear in wamp server for windows", "body": "This is just a reminder post for installing PHP PEAR in Wamp Server for windows, and a tutorial for people who want to install the PHP PEAR packages in Wamp server.\nFirst thing's first download `GOPEAR` which is a PHP archived version of the PEAR installer that we will use to install any packages. Save this file to your Wamp installations PHP binary directory (which for me is `C:\\opt\\wamp\\bin\\php\\php5.3.13`).\n\nnow open a command prompt as an administrator (right click on `cmd.exe` and choose \"run as administrator\") and type the following commands\n\n```\nphp go-pear.phar\n```\n\nchoose system for a system wide installation. When the program prompts you with a list, just press enter to accept the defaults.\nAfter the download has finished a file called `PEAR_ENV.reg` will be created. This file contains environment variables for PEAR. Just double click it and install the registry file. Now open the file `C:\\opt\\wamp\\bin\\php\\php5.3.13\\php.ini` and add the following\n\n```\ninclude_path = \".;C:\\opt\\wamp\\bin\\php\\php5.3.13\"\n```\n\n\nDon't forget to replace the path with your own installation directory. Add the same line to the file `C:\\opt\\wamp\\bin\\apache\\apache2.2.22\\bin\\php.ini` and restart apache. Now you can use the file `pear.bat` in `C:\\opt\\wamp\\bin\\php\\php5.3.13` to install any packages. E.g\n\n\n```\npear.bat install net_smtp\n```\n\nThat's all there is to it really...\n\n", "file": "install_php_pear_wamp_server.ipynb"}]</script>
