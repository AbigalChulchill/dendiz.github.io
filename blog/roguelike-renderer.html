The ordering is important because things overwrite each other. If you render the FoV before the player you will not see the player symbol '@' as it will be overwritten by a bright dot (the location of the player is always in the FoV). I decided that it would be a cleaner approach to have all the object render themselves and keep track of their dependencies that also need rendering. E.g the player now has a FoV object that it will ask to render itself before rendering itself (A lot of it selves there ...).\n", "\n", "This is accomplished by having a Renderable protocol that takes the GameScene which contains the actually methods to manipulate textures on the screen. The Game object has a reference to the GameScene object to it can pass it along to the objects that are Renderable.\n", "\n", "**Update 3: Animation overlay**\n", "\n", "After starting work on the animations I realized that using the illumination system to render explosion effects with alpha channel was going to be a pain because of the transparency required. I would need to find the glyphs for the tiles that have the explosion effect and adjust illumination to give a transparency / lighting effect. Even with this approach I still wouldn't get exactly what I wanted as the effects that illumination provide even when applied to the background is not really what an explosion or laser charing effect look like. So I decided to add another NxM array of cells to the scene as the overlay. This is where all the animation rendering happens and it sits at a higher Z index than the tile cells. Now when the animation is rendered on this layer I can adjust the transparency of the background for the cell to get great effects.\n", "\n", "![](/img/5.gif)\n"]}], "metadata": {"celltoolbar": "Tags", "kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.6.12"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
