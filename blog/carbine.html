It\u2019s a shoot\u2019em up style game where you start the map in the middle and all sorts of zombies, spiders, monsters start creeping up towards you and you have to shoot them and keep running away from them.

The new x,y coordinates are calculated as x = velocity * math.sin(direction) and y = vel * math.cos(direction) where direction is the angle that the zombie is facing. This angle has to be towards the player at some times if we ever want the player to drop dead. The angle is calculated as alpha = atan2(player.x-zombie.x, player.y-zombie.y) derived from some simple vector calculations\n", "\n", "![](/img/57f45260c7ec9.png)\n", "\n", "Blast effect when firing\n", "========================\n", "\n", "Implemented by swaping the sprites of the original player with sprites that have a blast at the end on the gun at each move() function call for the player if the fire_anim variable is enabled.

The a,s keys set the current player Y velocity to +maxspeed and -maxspeed and the a,d keys set the X velocity to -max and +max. They are triggered by the keydown event, and at each move() function call the coordinates are updated according to the value of the velocity variable. The keyup event sets these variables to zero. This way if the key is held in a pressed state the actor will keep moving.\n", "\n", "Player movement\n", "===============\n", "\n", "the direction of the player is calculated by taking the atan2 of the current player x,y and the current mouse x,y so that the player is always facing towards the cross-hair. If the velocity of the player is 0 than the current player sprite isn\u2019t swapped because we don\u2019t want the player to perform a moving animation otherwise the seconds that have passed from the game start is calculated form the current frame number and FPS and the correct sprite is selected form the sprite array of the player.\n", "\n", "Player rendering\n", "================\n", "\n", "The player is rendered on the canvas by translating the canvas to the player x,y and rotating the canvas by the player direction and drawing the current sprite from the sprite index.\n", "\n", "Player weapon firing\n", "====================\n", "\n", "If the bullet count is 0 the weapon is reloaded.

A weapon may fire multiple projectiles e.g shotgun. Rockets are also projectiles.The projectiles are stored in the C.projectiles array when they are displayable on the screen. Different types of projectiles may be present with different velocities and different damage factors. Location of the bullet is calculated each frame by the main event loop.
